We make these connections in a number of ways. We look at history, neighbouring buildings – what they are made of and how they are built – the street pattern, urban form, and the cultural and social setting. When we have looked carefully for clues on how we may introduce a new building we overlay the specific requirements of our project. This results in buildings that are finely tuned to their future use and introduced to their setting with care and consideration. These connections can happen on many levels, from the scale of the city through to a precise construction detail. They can be direct or quite abstract. Ultimately we hope that they enable a new reading of the building in relation to its site and that we enrich what we find.

Our experience in private residential work has afforded us the deepest understanding of complex architectural projects. With its innumerable details, ambitions and practical requirements, the design of a good home is perhaps one of the most challenging design problems for a designer or architect to undertake. We believe our developed sensitivity and extensive experience with this type of work has given us a leading advantage to creatively manage the myriad of design, technical and functional realms that go beyond private-residential into commercial, educational, public and cultural projects. We take a collaborative and organic approach to each project, embracing design as a unique problem-solving tool. Underpinned by over 15 years of teaching and a lifetime spent exploring the experiential qualities of space, Charles Tashima Architecture is committed to the continuous search for inventive solutions. Always in collaboration with our clients, fellow consultants and contractors, we strive for a positive, holistic and creatively fulfilling experience. A balance of intuitive and systematic responses informs our approach, arriving at results that reveal new and unexpected solutions and surprising outcomes.

It is balanced between the roles of architect, developer and an in-house construction team. Such a synergic structure informs the approach to the work and aims to address the restrictive and conventional practice of architecture which is often compromised by the realms of the everyday contingent. The triptych form encompasses new roles of the architect, informed client and craft based builder whilst reigniting the possibilities and return of the 'master builder'. The studio is driven by risks, autonomy, experimentation and reinvention. New typologies are as possible as new building briefs as in turn are new building technologies and methodologies. The research is applied and empirically tested through built works on site. Recently established, the practices first major project, DKH, received the RIBA award for London's best housing which supported and illuminated the possible achievements of this new formed practice. Whilst currently engaged with various scales of residential projects, the practice will soon explore other social conditions and set these within new building types.

Our client list includes local Councils such as Southwark and Newham, public housing associations, private developers as well as social enterprises. All our work is about building relationships that develop and evolve throughout the creative process: Architecture is part of a broader cultural condition with a specific set of human, environmental and historical circumstances that need to inform the design process.

We are interested in places, uses and the way they come about. By places we mean cities, spaces within them, buildings, and landscapes. We concentrate on projects of public relevance and have a close understanding of urban change. Our work has come to be internationally recognised for a patient and innovative role in adjusting and improving the urban fabric and its uses. Taking on the wide range of factors influencing and surrounding any process of creation is key to its success and usefulness. These factors include financial constraints, what is happening at the edge and around any project area, political intricacies affecting delivery, and close dialogue with users through carefully designed consultation processes. A careful understanding and documentation of places as they are found, their spatial relationships, colour, smell and materiality help our development and judgement of design. We are interested in responding to and influencing specific situations. Beauty is always an ambition, defined in form use and time. All places contain uses and most places come about with use in mind. The mix and location of uses is therefore intricately tied in with the success of a place although a place can never be defined by its use. Changing requirements stimulate the development of architecture where well functioning uses can mix with new, acknowledging that architecture is an intervention into a situation that influences its success and value. We use architecture to tickle, stimulate, and accommodate. We are a practice with a wide breadth of skills and knowledge. Our service is carefully programmed and tailored to the scale and specific requirements of each project and we actively choose to collaborate whenever appropriate with other disciplines, groups and individuals, and are used to acting as single point of contact for our clients as leaders of consultancy teams.

This self-initiated project allowed us to experiment with design concepts and detailing that has continued to inform our later work. We have continued this strategy of self-initiated development projects running alongside architectural services, which allows the practice to develop ideas and techniques at our own risk before these are implemented on client's projects. The practice brings over 17 years of experience in design and construction management, giving us the flexibility and knowledge to tailor our approach to any project. This dual approach to architecture and development also gives us an insight into the building process from a client's point of view, and wide experience with land acquisition, funding, budgeting and project management. For private clients, we have the experience to manage and deliver unique buildings cost effectively, and for commercial clients, we bring our development skills to help guide and unlock the viability of a project. We believe good architecture is the result of a close collaboration between client, architect, and expert consultants and makers. This begins with working closely to understand your needs at the start of a project, and continues through keeping you informed at every stage, and using our wide network of collaborators, contractors and expert consultants to achieve the best result.

EMGa is a design-led practice and the level of detail is very high, as is the finish it expects of its contractors and the teams throughout the process. Most of EMGa's commissions come through word of mouth, due to the quality of design and finishes and its delivery of projects on budget and on time.

The small things matter to us as much as the big things, and being alert to every possibility matters most of all. Tradition matters to us, too. We are – every one of us – inspired by the way things have always been done, by the age-old craft of making, by enduring materials such as marble, timber and steel. We’re drawn to the carpenter’s workshop, to the smells and the sawdust, and we delight in the clean, simple lines of mid-century furniture. Often, it’s the classical, timeless designs that we appreciate the most. Our projects are our way of bringing together all of these things. And every project is our chance to do something different, with a bold and distinctive idea at the heart of it which makes it inherently bespoke and personal to you. We never take the beaten track. We develop and shape our ideas carefully, thinking through every possibility, drawing by hand, making models, and handling different materials. From the first sketch, you’ll sense the possibilities. And through our intricate models you’ll start to understand the spaces we’re creating for you. But however well prepared you are, you’ll still be surprised by the impact that light, space and materials can have when we bring them together in just the right way.

Each project begins with a site, its context, and an open mind. We begin the design process at the end, with the people who will use the cities, buildings and spaces we design. What do those people need? What will make their lives better through our design? If we can envisage, understand and forecast their needs, we can bring that vision to life. Before we speak, we listen. Investing time to understand our client’s ambitions, the characteristics of the site, the needs of the occupants and the importance of the context is paramount. Good design does not occur in a vacuum. It takes great teams working together to realise a common goal. We communicate honestly and challenge respectfully. It’s an approach that has earned us rich, long-term relationships with some great people.

We rescue space to make places. We imagine new buildings where there are voids. We recycle bits of leftover architecture. We feel that design should be fun, ambitious and above all else empathetic. We respect the ideas of others and we like to listen. For us, Architecture is a unifying discipline - politics, regulation, location, design, finance, construction and user experience - that can maintain social and artistic concerns. It should be critical, balanced and multi-faceted with The Architect’s role being one of ‘opportunity provider’. We see an inventive approach to Design as part confrontation/part co-operation in the pursuit of strong solutions, simple construction & sensible costs. Parallel to our day to day architect-ing, fourth_space is creator of “The Negroni Talks…!” an informal, freewheeling and provocative debate series with a cafe-culture vibe. We also run Ombra, a venetian bar/restaurant a few doors down from our attic-like studio space, which functions both as our less formal ‘2nd meeting room’ and a place where we host events as a public facing extension of the practice.

Since then, our practice has grown in size and project scope, with the aim of constantly improving areas of our expertise, and where possible, beyond those boundaries, toward even broader fields. This has been achieved by consciously evolving our practice, and we've done this by placing learning, improving, and refining every aspect of what we do, at the very core of our business. This means being aware of opportunities as they arise, and being proactive in making positive change. Most visibly, it is this philosophy that led to our joining forces with Findlay Construction. We took repeated learnings from over a decade of practice, and saw that our most excellent work was realised through close relations, with our most excellent construction partners. To improve further therefore, we took the opportunity to evolve, and created our design and build offering. But it doesn't just stop there. Like evolution, the process is ongoing and underpins everything that we do, both internally and externally.

We all like to live, work and play in harmonious surroundings that we feel secure in; can find our way round in, have the right scale and use natural materials. Great buildings help underpin those places. But the best ones link arms with their neighbours rather than stand out and shout. They highlight the collective place rather than the individual icon.

We find we gain energy and creativity from the challenge of working from more intimate to grander scales; it makes us better, more intuitive designers. Our fundamental ambition is to design beautiful buildings that exceed our clients’ expectations. Buildings that both delight with poetics and satisfy with functional logic and efficiency. Our influences are broad and encompass the historical, modernism and contemporary vernaculars. This enables us to find a balance between place and context and a need for characterful architectural expression. Our pursuit of timeless design fits hand in glove with our commitment to sustainability, where we always seek to give priority to the existing building, the possibility of retrofit, supporting the circular economy and the use of natural and durable materials. This is not a bolt-on, but a core part of our design process from the inception of a project. We support the need to prioritise climate change and are members of Architects Declare. We work with a range of consultants on often highly complex projects with multiple stakeholders.

A building is not an artefact, instrument, or garment yet it is contemplated, used and in a sense, worn. Contemporary architecture stumbles from one to another of this plurality of aspects, never sure to which it ought to cleave hardest, pulled this way and that by the prevailing fashion. Some architects bend materials to their own ideas, others let their ideas be bent by materials: either way they coerce the subject into a simplicity of their own making, subjugated to the architect’s will or talent, whichever happens to be in greater credit. We take a different approach. For us architecture must have the richness of the life it encloses: no more and no less. Just as life is polymorphous—in the philosophical jargon—so must architecture be. It is no more than life reducible to any set of abstractions, no more one thing or another. Done well, it leaves all “-isms” at the door, calls on no general principles, answers with no stock phrases. Its solutions are local, whether globally admired or not, tailored to specifics, to a here and now however long or short that might last. And, crucially, it belongs to someone other than its author, for it must be part of the people who inhabit it or else it becomes just a stage, turning the life of its occupants into a reality show without an audience. It is the client’s identity—not ours—that should be embodied in their building, the organising intelligence should stay below the surface.

Our starting point is the understanding of the context and identifying relevant building types, new and ancient that we refine and thoroughly modernise. Our buildings inhabit a place between the familiar and the unexpected, a quality that includes and intrigues.

Since the forming of the practice in 1990, energy reduction has been a feature of many of the projects with many new houses, extensions and conversions being significantly better than the minimum required to meet the regulations. This interest has been expanded with designing to very low energy standards including the adoption of the Passivhaus standard for most new houses and, where possible, incorporating materials with low embodied energy and from low carbon and sustainable sources.

We have been named Healthcare Architect of the Year in 2008, Public Building Architect of the Year in 2011 and Housing Architect of the Year in 2021. We treat each housing project as an opportunity to think about how the buildings and spaces we construct can have a positive impact on people’s lives. From London’s first co-housing community at Copper Lane and our RIBA Stirling Prize-shortlisted student housing in Roehampton, to the RIBA Neave Brown Award-winning and Stirling Prize-shortlisted 333 Kingsland Road & Hackney New Primary School and local-authority led estate regeneration and infill projects across Hackney, to a residential tower in Hammersmith and Fulham, all these varied residential projects have the shared ambition of raising the standard of housing provision in the UK.

Our housing work is characterised by a rich and durable material palette, creativity within constrained budgets, robust detailing, attractive amenity space and most importantly carefully considered, attractive homes that form the backdrop to people’s daily lives. We are passionate about delivering fantastic homes that make a wider contribution to society, and believe that the variety and quality of our housing work stands out for the way in which high minded ideas are matched by an attention to detail, construction and an understanding of what makes a good home and an attractive place to live. Our projects demonstrate the variety of our approaches to housing design. We have delivered projects which not only repair the urban fabric but also raise the quality of a new generation of social housing with a civic quality. Our sensitive approach to estate regeneration ensures that attractive new homes are complemented by the meaningful transformations of existing buildings, addressing the disparity between ’us’ and 'them’. And we have shown how mixed-use schemes can bring residential and education or commercial uses together on one site to be more than the sum of their parts, exemplary approaches to hybrid architecture.

We work across all uses, programmes and scales employing passion, free-thinking, rigour and process in our responses to brief, context, sustainability and legacy. Design Approach: Our body of work is characterised by considered placemaking, simplicity of form, elegance of proportion, contextual abstraction and material composition. Our iterative design process informs an architectural language that runs throughout our work, with differentiation between projects provided through responses to context and programme to create moments of delight in composition, ordering, reveal, entrance, crown, colour, material palette and detail. Sustainability: We believe that architects have a pivotal role to play in helping society, humanity and the planet in a time of paradigm shift. We design and research for inherent and holistic long-term sustainability. We seek only to work on projects where their siting is in proximity to public transport and where they can contribute to a walkable city. We do not see a building as being designed for a singular use. We believe that buildings can only be considered sustainable if they can be proven to be adaptable to other future uses. The enduring nature of our architecture, the rationalism on which it is based, our employment of simple form and our use of robust materiality inherently provide for adaptability and longevity of use, with the aim for permanence to mitigate future need for recycling and re-use. We believe in the long-term benefits of contextualism in providing a sense of place, identity and ownership. This is realised in our work through in-depth research of the specific conditions of a site’s geographical, climatic, historical, social and cultural context with the aim to improve the quality of experience and engagement within the city through a creative reimagining of its contextual conditions. Social Responsibility: We believe in the importance of our role in engaging communities within the profession. We have a dedicated in-house team for Equality, Diversity, Inclusion & Community to bring in new initiatives and to help us ensure that our voice of advocacy is heard through internal and external communications. Their activities include working with the community and local schools with the aim of increasing the awareness and understanding of architecture and the built environment in order to help make the profession more visible and accessible to young people from all backgrounds who might not otherwise have considered a career in architecture. Research: Continuous research is a key element in the continuous development of our practice. Our ongoing research programmes include ‘Twelve Sites’, a mapping of the city of Berlin; ‘The Death of the High Street’ looking at the densification and re-population of town centres, and and the development of the ‘Universal Building’, an adaptable building typology to ensure future longevity of use.

In the context of current overwhelming pressures on the planet's environment, there is an increasingly urgent need for architects to understand and embrace the doubt and uncertainty inherent to science in general (and quantum mechanics in particular), as well as the logical, rational enquiry and mathematical truth at the base of the scientific method. Combining artistic and scientific concerns, architecture has always been a discipline that bridges the ‘two cultures’. In our era of unprecedented and accelerating change driven by technology, the fundamental concerns of architecture remain unchanged. These involve the design of sculptured social space for improved quality of life, animated by light, of durable construction with appropriate use of technology, environmental responsibility and sensual materiality, with a connectedness to place, all combining to give an emotional charge. The best buildings are a backdrop to peoples lives, that still subtly engender a sense of wonder and delight (400 years of scientific investigation only adds to the same wonder at nature, when we look at, and understand, the stars or a flower). To remain relevant, contemporary architecture, like all art, must also continually evolve new forms that reflect the present and lead us into the future. In order to respond to the changes we will experience this century, this requires architecture to incorporate a working knowledge of current science and mathematics (which in underpinning new technology, as well as being the best method of understanding the world, form the dominant intellectual discourse).

The aim in every project is to meet the client’s brief precisely while creating spaces that fully meet the objectives of ‘Light, Space, Greenery’ – spaces that are harmonious and a joy to experience and live in and around, while meeting their functional purpose. In residential projects the objective wherever possible is to optimize the relationship between house and garden. While having a profound love of historic architecture and a close interest in its conservation, he has never felt that this was sufficient by itself, because the quality of our future environment will inevitably depend largely on what we build now, how we meet our own needs. So the creation of new structures of quality has to go hand in hand with conservation of the best of the past. James Dunnett has as a result made a close study of the history and theory of the architecture and urbanism of the last hundred years – research reflected in the texts forming part of this website – to understand why we are where we are in architecture, to pick up on the best in it while identifying its shortcomings, and to move forward to new creation on the basis of understanding. As a long-standing member of the Green Register he recognises that the need radically to reduce the stress placed on the natural environment by rapidly rising levels of human consumption calls for a new chapter in the development of architectural form.

Our projects are establishing a social and a physical legacy. We achieve this by embracing an open, interactive design process that responds positively to the needs and aspirations of the people we work with. By allowing the process to drive the project, we have built a portfolio of inventive projects, each of which makes the most of the unusual opportunities and particular challenges of its site context. Our method stimulates innovative design, and always seeks to add benefits through education, economic growth, cultural activity or greater community coherence. We believe that an integrated approach is needed for any place to fulfil its potential. This conviction has led us to work across sectors, including regeneration, housing, economic development, education, public space and planning. In each field, our projects are united by their public purpose. For us, sustainability is more than just a technological challenge. By engaging a broad community in frank and open conversation from the outset of a project, we can work to ensure that our proposals are needed, useful and proportionate. Throughout design, procurement and delivery, we look for opportunities to re-activate existing spaces, use reclaimed or surplus materials and tap into local supply networks. Looking ahead, we are researching how the spaces we design and the strategies we develop can accommodate change, through flexible design strategies to demountable construction techniques. Sustainability must be a shared pursuit, and we hope to inspire others through our work. Our approach has been recognised by numerous national and international design awards. We are aware that design excellence is a team effort, and invest ourselves in our work and our professional relationships.

We believe that buildings should be underpinned by a powerful idea; that the idea should be an intelligent and logical response to functionality and a sense of place; and the power of that idea should be embedded in the built form. That way, clients get the buildings they need and society gets the architecture it deserves. We believe that the city is one of humanity's most impressive and precious cultural achievements. We also believe that cities are about connections, transport, communications, public spaces and joy. We believe in locating our buildings firmly within their contexts – not as slavish repetition but as a considered response to site, materiality, amenity, scale and culture.

We love to explore how people live, learn and play. We offer full architectural services, and can tailor our services to meet our clients’ needs. We help land owners (or prospective land owners) understand the potential of a site and the added value that can be bought to it through a small or mid-sized residential development. We can help with viability studies by quickly appraising the potential built area and arrangements that can fit on a plot; and go on to design and deliver high quality, sustainable homes. We design developments that are appropriate in scale, massing and character in relation to the context. This approach to place-making can help achieve planning permission in sensitive locations. We are interested in re-interpreting traditional typologies in contemporary ways. We can help our clients deliver homes that are inclusive, relevant and desirable for modern life. We are particularly valued for our involvement at the very early stages of a project to help define the right brief, appraise options and set a firm bedrock for the project. Each project has its own story formed through considering the PEOPLE, PLACE and PLANET. PEOPLE: We start with people. Our designs are generated by how we understand people will use the spaces. This can produce solutions that haven’t yet been anticipated. We build in flexibility so the building can adapt and grow, which also gives the project long term value for money. PLACE: We understand a building doesn’t exist in a vacuum, but in a physical and environmental context. It should have a meaningful conversation with its surroundings. This doesn’t mean the architecture needs to blend in – it can be respectful as well as bold and brave. PLANET: We aim to create responsible buildings. Embedded within all our designs is the ambition to make genuinely sustainable, accessible and inclusive projects, and we have in-house expertise to achieve this.

For the past 27 years we have worked at almost every scale on many types of building in every sector - from individual houses to social and private housing schemes, cultural and commercial projects, new-buildings and renovations. We have expertise and deep interest in heritage and conservation design, and extensive academic and professional experience of working with listed buildings and in conservation areas. We have won a number of awards including The Royal Fine Art Commission's Building Beauty Little Gem award for Westminster Coroner's Court in 2024, and best office building at The World Architecture Festival in 2016. Publishers regularly feature our work in architectural journals across the world. Marsh View, a house that we crafted out of parts of a 1950s Norfolk bungalow between 2003-8, was described in The Observer by Stephen Bailey, as ""masterpiece"", and Ellis Woodman, the director of the Architecture Foundation, observed in the Architects Journal in 2016 that ""Lynch Architects' buildings at Victoria should see us all out."" We were privileged to exhibit our work at the Venice Biennale in 2008 and in 2012, and at the Milan Triennial in 2018. Our finished buildings looks remarkably similar to the CGIs made of them early in the design process, because we believe in the craft of architecture, and that good design entails editing and refinement, what might be called the search for a poetic economy of means. As well as teaching and a commitment to working with teenagers within our community, we run a small publishing house from within the practice, Canalside Press, which publishes the Journal of Civic Architecture (JoCA) as well as books on the history of modern architecture, photography and poetry.

Game Theory is the mathematical study of decision-making between people in situations of conflict or cooperation. So that means any time a decision is to be made between 2 or more people, whether negotiation is involved or not, you can use Game Theory to help identify which is the best decision or strategy to take. And because we are all constantly making strategic decisions in both our professional and personal lives, most of the time without even realising it, the application of Game Theory is huge. Mzo Tarr Architects use the precise framework and mathematical tools of Game Theory as an alternative to gaining an insight into a person’s decision and reasoning. This different approach identifies alternative opportunities as well as problems, directly driving the design and function of our buildings. For example, by listing all potential choices available to those affected by a project and by quantifying the potential benefits (payoffs) to each party in making those choices, we are able to identify the best decision (best response) for an individual or parties. Game Theory informs our design process as we navigate between the many interested parties to give our clients what they want, often involving planners, neighbours, investors, even market conditions. Our buildings also continue to use Game Theory after they are built, as they respond to the lives and decisions of their occupants. Visit our Pursuit project as an example of how. We have applied this approach to +150 projects all over the world. These range from art installations to towers.

We consider these issues to be more important than working in a particular style and hope that each project will be an original interpretation of the client, site, brief and budget. This practice does not specialise in particular building types. We consider our specialism to be high quality architecture and enjoy having a broad range of projects in the office; from town master plans, to schools, health centres, community buildings, group housing, private residential houses, exhibitions, furniture and bandstands. For us, practice is understood as a range of activities which are all necessary to each other – design of buildings, fittings and furniture; making buildings, installations and models; connecting speculation and practice, lecturing and writing about architecture; collaborations with craftsmen, artists and consultants. We use a great range of materials in our building projects. We enjoy it most when we inventively combine traditional and new construction techniques. We relish unexpected juxtapositions. All of our designs are discussed with the makers, not just in terms of performance, but also as aesthetic propositions. A good builder generally has a good eye. The work shown here is less interested in the expression of technology by bolts, junctions and gaskets, more in the overall presence of a space. In particular the way in which materials alter space by modulating light; combing it, diffusing it, storing it, reflecting it, dulling it or changing its speed.

As a practice, we are wholly interested in the realisation of contemporary architecture, responding to various social and cultural influences by focusing on the latent possibilities inherent in each project. We approach each design exercise as a collaborative effort, one that demands an intimate understanding of both Client and Brief before the design process can begin. By working this closely with our Clients, we hope to instil a sense of curiosity and excitement, stimulating a response and confronting some of the more restrictive prejudices and traditional preconceptions of contemporary architecture. As designers, we aspire to a simplicity distilled from a core concept, itself a product of both brief and site. We work to develop these concepts with an honesty and transparency and through the careful arrangement and detailing of materials, this process culminates in the creation of specifically detailed structures with a clear relationship to their specific context. In recent years we have grown our practice outside of Ireland, opening offices in both London and New York and currently we are developing a number of projects in the UK and Portugal.

The studio designs at all scales - from masterplans, tall buildings and deep retrofits to interiors and furniture - and are unified by a desire to improve the human experience in a way that is poetic, contextual, resilient and climate responsive. Research partnerships with UCL and Westminster University are integral to the Studio's approach and many of the senior team hold academic posts. Piercy&Co’s research driven approach has resulted in a portfolio of award-winning buildings in the residential, commercial and cultural sectors. The Studio enjoys long-standing relationships with ambitious clients including Argent, Stanhope, British Land, Derwent London and The Crown Estate. Our residential work is purposefully diverse in scale and budget. From bespoke one-off houses to large multi-residential buildings and masterplans, our work aims to create places that people feel good in. We approach this at both the micro - a human centred approach to spatial planning and material selection - and at the macro - buildings that connect with their specific architectural, cultural and environmental contexts. We are committed to making sustainable and long-lived buildings, believing that the very qualities which make a building resilient over the long term are also those that make a home feel good to live in. Current projects include 72 social housing apartments on the King’s Cross masterplan at Plot R8; 200 new homes at Paddington Green for Berkeley Group; and 160 homes across two residential towers at Camden Goods Yard. We are also working as part of a six architect team reimagining the former Olympic Park site at East Wick and Sweetwater, designing 300 homes to include market, private rented and affordable tenures with a mix of terraces and apartments.

Over the past five decades we have built up an enviable track-record working with communities, local authorities and commercial clients to create buildings and places people want to live in. Using the full range of skills at our disposal, from architectural and urban design to masterplanning, property development and community engagement, our team of 120 professionals are dedicated to enhancing the towns, cities and villages in which we work. And while we have the resources and financial strength of a large practice we are able to offer a personal service more commonly associated with smaller studios. We understand the specific needs of our clients and where and what they seek to build: in short, as our award-winning project portfolio shows, we understand how sustainable placemaking works. We are equally comfortable tackling smaller bespoke building projects as we are masterplanning villages, towns and urban districts. We handle all stages of a project from concept and planning to delivery and post-occupancy evaluation. Our approach is founded on placing people first, understanding their needs and designing to suit, emphasising not only the way the buildings and places look, but also on how they are made, how they are used and how they age too. As well as designing new neighbourhoods and estates we also repair and revitalise existing ones in need of care. This in turn has helped us build a reputation for taking over difficult projects which have stalled and re-energising them to create thriving places people enjoy being in. We have recently completed a comprehensive remodelling of our spacious studios at Diespeker Wharf, a converted factory in Islington and a local landmark, to facilitate hybrid working and provide an outstanding venue for client meetings and industry events. We’ve earned the respect of our peers too, winning more than 250 awards over the years, with recent wins including BD Housing Architect of the Year 2017, AJ Sustainable Practice of the year in 2018 and British Homes Awards Architect of the Year 2020.

Our design process encompasses the relationships people have with buildings, spaces and each other. Taking a broader approach not only leads to strong physical connections, through massing and form, it also fosters strong emotional connections with the community. Joining everything up does, however, necessitate a different architectural mindset. Local neighbourhoods, by their very nature, involve many stakeholders, and accommodating every point of view can lead to numerous compromises. The best schemes, we believe, are those that reach consensus by shaping an overarching vision, which the whole community will support. Rather than begin with design concepts, we start with the best overall experience and then work back to the architecture needed to deliver it. For us, design should create an experience that delights and improves the lives of everyone. We believe the only way to do this is with a joined up approach.

We work collaboratively and flexibly with often complex stakeholder and client groups to accommodate project-specific processes and timelines. Our small team brings creativity and extensive experience to project development. We pay attention to detail and are committed to delivering all our work to a high standard. Our selection to the Mayor of London’s A+U Framework (2023) to support High Street & Town Centre Recovery has recognised the quality of our practice. We seek to work with clients who want to explore creative approaches in response to the biodiversity and climate crisis. Below an overview of our interests and the fields of work we engage with: HOUSING ENVIRONMENTS: We work in the social housing context to adapt existing buildings, transform shared open spaces, and create the social infrastructure that complements housing. Our participatory process is guided by a commitment to sustainability and resilience. BUILDING DESIGN: Embracing a non-fussy, simple, and restrained design language, we have refurbished, reconfigured, and expanded existing structures to accommodate changing needs and designed proposals for zero-carbon public buildings. ACTIVE TRAVEL: We design urban environments around active, human-powered transport to reduce air pollution and enhance living conditions. Collaborating with stakeholders such as local governments, policymakers, campaign groups, highway engineers, schools, and citizens, we develop strategies and deliver projects prioritising cycling and walking. PUBLIC SPACE: Our public realm work focuses on ordinary streets and neglected open spaces. We collaborate with neighbourhoods and borough councils to create urban environments that improve the quality of life for people and nature. Greening is a key objective – from tree planting to sustainable urban drainage solutions. URBAN RESILIENCE: Our projects leverage local knowledge and community participation to create more equitable, climate-resilient urban environments. We support grassroots organisations in their efforts to effect change locally. Small projects can bring powerful, positive outcomes for people and places. ARTISTIC PRACTICE: Our work is grounded in artistic practice and evolved through art commissions and collaborations. These initiatives are calls for action, provocations and critiques of given conditions. They are a testbed for ideas and, at times, the beginning of something new.

Our mission is to enable sustainable life through the art of architecture. Our vision is that by 2030 all our architecture will be climate neutral, through design excellence. Responsibility, curiosity, involvement and respect are core values that imbue everything we do. Our values remain the constant in a world of change. We work with sustainable architecture, design and urban development in an international context. We need to act responsibly as our work affects the lives of many both present and future generations. We create spaces for people to thrive and grow in harmony with the ecosystem that we inhabit. We act responsibly by operating within the sustainable limits of our planet when we design healthy living environments that inspire and engage. Our curiosity is reflected in the way we work. We believe that search for new knowledge will strengthen our offer for the future. Therefore, we continuously invest in research and development. Through design, creativity and a humanistic approach, we look to solve great challenges. We believe that architecture is shaped by the unique qualities of its context. This makes us radical contextualists. Our 700+ employees are continually developing their knowledge base and generating innovative typologies and tools, and White Research Lab and our R&D foundation both support research projects geared towards creating maximum value in projects. We have design skills to tackle major regeneration schemes in the rapid transition from an industrial to a technological age. Key projects reflecting the scale of that transition and our experience include the making of Hammarby Sjöstad in central Stockholm – the city’s first ‘environmentally profiled’ regeneration projects. Hammarby, in which White played a prominent role, is one of Europe’s most highly regarded urban regeneration projects. Our recent Completion of 1200 homes on the Gascoigne Estate in Barking, is an example of delivering a high density landscape led masterplan.
