Our projects seek to connect the historic, cultural, spatial and material qualities of a place with the intent to complement and reinforce the particular conditions of their setting. We make these connections in a number of ways. We look at history, neighbouring buildings – what they are made of and how they are built – the street pattern, urban form, and the cultural and social setting. When we have looked carefully for clues on how we may introduce a new building we overlay the specific requirements of our project. This results in buildings that are finely tuned to their future use and introduced to their setting with care and consideration. These connections can happen on many levels, from the scale of the city through to a precise construction detail. They can be direct or quite abstract. Ultimately we hope that they enable a new reading of the building in relation to its site and that we enrich what we find.

We feel performance should be fundamental to design – not an afterthought. We ask questions about environment and impact. When does the sun shine in a window? Where do our materials come from,? How much energy do our buildings consume? We guide projects from the first feasibility questions to the final completion, developing conceptual design solutions and exceptional technical detailing to ensure that our buildings perform to their design standards, require little maintenance and are a pleasure to use. Founded in 2010, we aim to create projects which are both responsive and responsible. By responsive we mean approaching each design exercise as a collaborative effort, one that demands an intimate understanding of both Client and Brief before the design process can begin. By responsible, we mean designing and procuring our buildings in a way which does not have an adverse impact on the environment.

This process allows us to make characterful, timeless yet contemporary projects which complement and reinforce the qualities of a place.

Much of our work seeks to ease new life into old buildings - we have worked on over 30 listed buildings - and sustainable building and environment technologies are at the heart of our thinking. At all times we are conscious of our clients’ budgetary and programme concerns and help to plan and progress their projects to conclusion.

Our designs respond with vision to private clients’ books, art and furniture, and form optimal settings for their specific lifestyles and aspirations. Work for arts and education clients, often carried out in phases, embodies the values and missions of the institutions.

    "description": "Architecture Doing Place are an architecture and urban design practice, who aim to produce beautiful buildings and spatial interventions from our immersion in the arts and contemporary architecture. We are drawn to the palimpsest of place. Like us, this is a product of layers of heritage; Like us, this contributes productively to our current and future places. It seems logical to us that our projects share not only this purpose, but also a sensitivity and delight in an aspect of place commonly described by architects as ‘context’. We believe our contexts can be eloquent extensions of who we are. As individuals, as communities, as an inclusive society. We seek to nourish this idea in our projects, by applying what drew us to our vocation in the first place; The simple production of “… a good thing, well made”. Our methodology begins with a focus on the end users. Architectural work involves significant cost and resources and will typically endure in the world for years at a time. We try to be thoughtful about the wider impact of our work, including its implications for the city and all its citizens; ensuring always that we are “… giving the mundane its beautiful due”. Our design approach is marked by our investment of playfulness, wit, intelligence, respect, hard work, imagination and craft. We enjoy accompanying clients one step at a time, along this journey.

We specialize in working with challenging sites and complex briefs, where our fresh thinking and inventive design can most benefit our clients and those who use the places we make. Our work has won many awards and is widely published in Britain and abroad. Tucked into an old London mews, Ash Sakula’s studio is a former stable that opens up like a box of tricks. It is a place to conjure up architecture, a place to be pioneering, agile and energetic. Surfing the before-during-and-after cycles of architecture, we toggle nimbly between new digital platforms and older disciplines of architectural craft, between static and moving images and between different scales, from zoomed-in details to the broad sweep of a city-centre masterplan.

    "description": "When we set up Atomik we had an idea of a practice that was about indivisibility. It was about bringing together an uncommonly diverse group of people who would collaborate to become something more than the sum of its constituent parts. The work we’ve produced together is equally surprising and varied, ranging from projects where the emphasis is on technical problem solving, through to more ideas-led schemes where the focus is on craft and concept. All are unified by a desire to design with purpose and integrity. If we are asking the right questions in the brief, then we can find the right solution in the architecture.

Our success is based on the trust we receive from our clients for consistently and reliably designing and delivering projects to the highest of standards.

It is not the work of a single hand with a set agenda or style; it is the work of a body of talented individuals collaborating with a diverse team of specialist consultants to provide a complete solution for the client. We interpret the complex and contrasting needs of clients, development control and construction and merge these with the findings of thorough site analysis and interrogation of the brief. This allows each project to be unique and directly linked to its location. Implementation is at the heart of B+R and all of our architects and designers have a true understanding that the needs of the customer are paramount when designing and delivering any project. This focus is combined with a clear awareness that the client experience needs to be balanced with the requirement to deliver projects on time, to budget and to the highest quality.

Our London based practice searches out logical solutions that respond to complex sites and challenging briefs. We begin by listening to our clients, recording and then responding to their needs with thoughtful architecture. Our work doesn’t focus on a style or an architectural image, but about how we can create sustainable buildings that improve the lives of those using them. This approach to wellbeing has enabled us to work with charitable bodies and social housing providers, but equally resolve the needs of both national and international commercial businesses. At the core of this thinking is a desire to create spaces that react responsibly to their context and deliver buildings which use resources responsibly. Who we work with is important to us, as is the ethics of our partners who supply services such as banking, utilities and cleaning. These business choices have influenced our work to date and guide our future plans. Our focus is on finding innovative ways through teamwork to resolve problems which benefit both our clients and those who use their buildings. Skills learnt from our private, third sector and public work influence each other, allowing wider benefits to inform all our work.

    "description": "Brian O’Reilly Architects is a London based RIBA Chartered architecture and design studio, established in January 2004 by Brian & Tijen O’Reilly. The formation of the practice is the result of their desire to bring together their experience and ideas and to determine their own architecture as well as to realise their designs and make things happen. The practice has designed, transformed, restored and created many built projects. We consider every new project as a fresh challenge, tailored to a specific context, requirements of the client, site conditions and budget. Increasingly our portfolio includes conservation and work to listed buildings. Our approach is to deliver well conceived and detailed projects to our clients with strong emphasis on design and inventive use of building materials. The practice enjoys engaging in a range of disciplines needed to make a good project from spatial studies to detailed furniture design. All of our designs are a collaboration with our clients, builders & craftsmen. We draw on our personal cultural heritage and our environment to provide inspiration. We are inspired by authenticity of buildings, context, materials, light, design and people. We look to the visual arts and our surroundings for inspiration.

Clarity is an important theme in all our work, and this manifests itself in many ways – in the overall form of a space, in how it is lit, in the materials used to create it. Thoroughness and attention to detail have become hallmarks of our work, and we take particular pride in the level of care we assign to all stages of a project. Most of our work comes through word-of-mouth referrals, and we receive a considerable amount of repeat commissions from clients.

We have been in practice since 1990, developing a level of quality that has been widely recognised by awards and publication. We are winners of the Stirling Prize, and Adam Caruso and Peter St John are academicians of the Royal Academy. We carry out a wide range of work, including commercial, residential, cultural and leisure buildings, and including new-build and renovation, and permanent and temporary commissions. We welcome this diversity – it helps to make each project distinctive, and for different projects to learn from each other. We have a strong record of working in UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other historic locations. We have also demonstrated our ability to design confident new buildings on sites without recognised conservation value. Our size gives us the capacity to handle large-scale commissions, while ensuring that our principals Adam Caruso and Peter St John can give close attention to each project. Adam and Peter both teach architecture, at ETH Zurich and London Metropolitan University. Their practice and their teaching benefit each other, bringing together the fresh thinking of students with the experience of a successful office. We have a strong interest in contemporary art, and have worked with leading artists such as Thomas Demand, Damien Hirst and Jeremy Deller. This interest enriches our architectural work, giving perspectives and insights into the physical qualities of buildings.

He and his team of architects have built a portfolio of elegant top-end residential projects in London and across the UK, underpinned by inventive and progressive designs for schools and other public arenas. Charles honed his design skills working in New York and for American architects in London and does not feel constrained by the cultural mores of either old or new worlds; he identifies and develops the essence of a project, the strong design idea that makes it special. He works personally with each and every one of his clients to create projects that are both architecturally accomplished and deeply personal to those who have commissioned the work and will occupy it. Architectural excellence, he believes, can only emerge from a genuine design conversation between the client and their architect.

In process we celebrate diversity, textural richness and materiality with a heightened attention to detail. Building the fabric and routine of our daily lives, our ethos is open, adaptive and resourceful as we seek timeless atmospheres, rich in qualities and spatial experience. Our experience in private residential work has afforded us the deepest understanding of complex architectural projects. With its innumerable details, ambitions and practical requirements, the design of a good home is perhaps one of the most challenging design problems for a designer or architect to undertake. We believe our developed sensitivity and extensive experience with this type of work has given us a leading advantage to creatively manage the myriad of design, technical and functional realms that go beyond private-residential into commercial, educational, public and cultural projects. We take a collaborative and organic approach to each project, embracing design as a unique problem-solving tool. Underpinned by over 15 years of teaching and a lifetime spent exploring the experiential qualities of space, Charles Tashima Architecture is committed to the continuous search for inventive solutions. Always in collaboration with our clients, fellow consultants and contractors, we strive for a positive, holistic and creatively fulfilling experience.

We now specialise in delivering bold and efficient commercial developments on behalf of investors and property developers. In the same way we can convert a 35 sqm studio flat into smart accommodation for four people, our design led approach allows us to unlock a site’s potential and create value for our clients. All our projects start with a methodical analysis of the site constraints and the local context. Volumes are shaped in order to maximise site’s capacity, whilst making sure the proposal sits well within the urban context and complies with the local planning policies. Spaces are designed to be flexible, adaptable and filled with natural light, so people can enjoy them to live, work and play. Materials and details are added, with the aim to establish a dialogue with the neighbouring buildings and at the same time ensure durability and sustainability.

We have established a reputation for original, transformative, and considered designs and built work that investigate and interrogate both context and form. Context is not just the physical surroundings but also the social, personal, cultural, and historical uniqueness of place. Each project is approached analytically; testing and pushing the design through digital media, exploratory models, and precision mock-ups. This rigorous method ensures clear, confident design and is an effective tool in negotiating the complexities of the building process, with unique concepts that challenge our clients, their brief, and ambitions. Whatever the nature of the project, the core and resolute objective of our work is to contextually define an essential design concept that drives direction, decisions, and details, resulting in a truly unique design.

The biggest lesson I’d learnt from 13 years at London-based practice Jestico & Whiles, was that successful design is born out of close collaboration between an architect and their client. People I’d designed for over the years had often told me they valued the effort I made to get to know them. By putting conversation at the heart of the process and actively listening to what clients need and want throughout a design project, I believe we have the edge in making our ideas work specifically for the individual – as well as more opportunity to demonstrate our skill, creativity and ingenuity.

Many of these buildings can be brought back into use and enjoyed without having to resort to wasteful demolition. Our projects include significant listed inter-war and post war buildings such as Utzon’s Ahm House and apartments in Lubetkin’s Highpoint. Our conviction is to build for the future and to build responsibly; conserving energy and resources during construction and throughout a building’s life.

It is balanced between the roles of architect, developer and an in-house construction team. Such a synergic structure informs the approach to the work and aims to address the restrictive and conventional practice of architecture which is often compromised by the realms of the everyday contingent. The triptych form encompasses new roles of the architect, informed client and craft based builder whilst reigniting the possibilities and return of the 'master builder'. The studio is driven by risks, autonomy, experimentation and reinvention. New typologies are as possible as new building briefs as in turn are new building technologies and methodologies. The research is applied and empirically tested through built works on site. Recently established, the practices first major project, DKH, received the RIBA award for London's best housing which supported and illuminated the possible achievements of this new formed practice. Whilst currently engaged with various scales of residential projects, the practice will soon explore other social conditions and set these within new building types.

    "description": "We design architecture that is responsive to the context, the client, and deeply rooted in the belief that we leave the city better than we found it. We don’t believe in following short term trends or applying an in-house style. We design and construct considered buildings that will endure over time. We have a deep appreciation of how buildings are built and the trades and craftsmen that construct what we design – considering the practical application of our designs is integral to how we design from the outset of a project. Cuozzo Fleming have been engaged and successfully worked on numerous highly constrained sites, both urban and rural, working within AONBs, Greenbelt, Ancient Woodlands, Conservation Areas, Employment Priority Areas, and on numerous listed buildings including those on the Heritage At Risk register. We have planning and construction experience across all London Boroughs, throughout the south east, and in Northern Ireland, but relish working in new territories whenever the opportunity arises.

The practice has over 45 years of design and technical experience, from inception through to delivery. CZWG was co-founded in 1975 by Nicholas Campbell, Roger Zogolovich, Rex Wilkinson and Piers Gough, and has a long and established history of design quality. Our architecture has been widely recognised within the industry through architectural, housing and regeneration awards. In 2018, Historic England listed six CZWG buildings for their contribution to postmodern architecture. Our approach is inspired by context and genuine collaboration with clients and end-users. We pride ourselves on our experience and understanding of the planning process and requirements. We are specialists at unlocking the viability of tricky sites within statutory guidelines and creating value through design, quality of accommodation and optimising density and site efficiencies. Using design to anchor new neighbourhoods and homes to their surrounding local context can enrich an area and evoke a strong visual identity to which people respond. We aspire to cultivate this sense of ownership and to help establish the community stewardship of a place. Address 1 Naoroji Street London, WC1X0GB Twitter @czwg Instagram czwgarchitects",

Good places are a product of those that use, design and make them and so, though we are a small studio, we work as part of a much larger family of collaborators. Our intent is to make buildings that feel settled, inevitable. They are connected – with the history of the site, the local landscape and natural resources, the desires of the client, with references both canny and uncanny, and the talents of their makers. Made without baggage, they are apt and original. They are good places to be. We describe our sort of architecture as having a profound normality. It may not shout loud, but it runs deep, revealing – in quiet, joyful ways and over the longer term – the quality and care with which it was built.

Our client list includes local Councils such as Southwark and Newham, public housing associations, private developers as well as social enterprises. All our work is about building relationships that develop and evolve throughout the creative process: Architecture is part of a broader cultural condition with a specific set of human, environmental and historical circumstances that need to inform the design process. Through this process, our clients become collaborators, and conversations expand beyond the architectural or urban confines of a project and often involve engaging a wider community through consultation in both the public and private sector, where our in-depth understanding of the planning system has resulted in a highly successful track record of achieving planning consent. Delvendahl Martin Architects are currently working in collaboration with Hawkins\\Brown and Studio Weave on the Hackney Wick Central Masterplan for Notting Hill Genesis and Equans, delivering 190 homes across three sites.

We work across many building types, cultures, climates and scales, on buildings that often have multiple users and functions. To each, we apply a clear design concept and a shared vision that enables us to deliver buildings of outstanding quality which are not only responsive and functional to client needs, budgets and their surrounds, but which also create a truly unique user experience.

Such exposure has allowed us to push forward our ethos: that good quality design should be a response to place. At Dualchas we believe it is the responsibility of architects to be advocates for the built environment and leaders within our communities, and we intend to continue spreading the word – to architecture students, the general public, and politicians.

By places we mean cities, spaces within them, buildings, and landscapes. We concentrate on projects of public relevance and have a close understanding of urban change. Our work has come to be internationally recognised for a patient and innovative role in adjusting and improving the urban fabric and its uses. Taking on the wide range of factors influencing and surrounding any process of creation is key to its success and usefulness. These factors include financial constraints, what is happening at the edge and around any project area, political intricacies affecting delivery, and close dialogue with users through carefully designed consultation processes. A careful understanding and documentation of places as they are found, their spatial relationships, colour, smell and materiality help our development and judgement of design. We are interested in responding to and influencing specific situations. Beauty is always an ambition, defined in form use and time. All places contain uses and most places come about with use in mind. The mix and location of uses is therefore intricately tied in with the success of a place although a place can never be defined by its use. Changing requirements stimulate the development of architecture where well functioning uses can mix with new, acknowledging that architecture is an intervention into a situation that influences its success and value. We use architecture to tickle, stimulate, and accommodate. We are a practice with a wide breadth of skills and knowledge. Our service is carefully programmed and tailored to the scale and specific requirements of each project and we actively choose to collaborate whenever appropriate with other disciplines, groups and individuals, and are used to acting as single point of contact for our clients as leaders of consultancy teams.

We have continued this strategy of self-initiated development projects running alongside architectural services, which allows the practice to develop ideas and techniques at our own risk before these are implemented on client's projects. The practice brings over 17 years of experience in design and construction management, giving us the flexibility and knowledge to tailor our approach to any project. This dual approach to architecture and development also gives us an insight into the building process from a client's point of view, and wide experience with land acquisition, funding, budgeting and project management. For private clients, we have the experience to manage and deliver unique buildings cost effectively, and for commercial clients, we bring our development skills to help guide and unlock the viability of a project. We believe good architecture is the result of a close collaboration between client, architect, and expert consultants and makers. This begins with working closely to understand your needs at the start of a project, and continues through keeping you informed at every stage, and using our wide network of collaborators, contractors and expert consultants to achieve the best result. Our work has been widely published nationally and internationally and has won many awards, including RIBA London awards in 2015 and 2016. In we were shortlisted for the Stephen Lawrence Prize and were runner up for the RIBA London Emerging Architect of the Year Award.

We have a lot of experience in working on sites with complex and particular constraints. A lot of the work we have undertaken has been modification and retrofitting of existing buildings. Rear Extensions; Basement extensions; Loft extensions; internal reconfigurations and fitouts. It can be an extremely rewarding experience to see through the transformation of an existing building and unlock new possibilities within it. There are particular stages within a project when things are stripped back and alternative spaces can be seen beyond what is existing at the time. It is the job of your architect to reveal these possibilities to you in advance within a process that allows you to make good decisions and get the most out of what for most people is a once in a lifetime project.

We value on-going relationships over one-off quick-fix deals; lasting performance over short-term gain.

The dynamic nature of culture requires that buildings have an in-built sense of order, a consistency against which we can test our experience. FMA’s work generates these internal orders in built forms by each time assembling them in such a way as to construct a unique transversal organisation across the complex array of relevant materials. Each FMA project accordingly has a singular physical presence with a new sense of order relative to the multifarious materials that relate to it and it shapes people’s experience of everyday life in unique ways.

    "description": "Our projects are all about possibility. How can we frame light and space to create impact? How can we harness natural materials to do something unexpected? How can we make the most of every little detail to create something extraordinary? The small things matter to us as much as the big things, and being alert to every possibility matters most of all. Tradition matters to us, too. We are – every one of us – inspired by the way things have always been done, by the age-old craft of making, by enduring materials such as marble, timber and steel. We’re drawn to the carpenter’s workshop, to the smells and the sawdust, and we delight in the clean, simple lines of mid-century furniture. Often, it’s the classical, timeless designs that we appreciate the most. Our projects are our way of bringing together all of these things. And every project is our chance to do something different, with a bold and distinctive idea at the heart of it which makes it inherently bespoke and personal to you. We never take the beaten track. We develop and shape our ideas carefully, thinking through every possibility, drawing by hand, making models, and handling different materials. From the first sketch, you’ll sense the possibilities. And through our intricate models you’ll start to understand the spaces we’re creating for you. But however well prepared you are, you’ll still be surprised by the impact that light, space and materials can have when we bring them together in just the right way. We love that moment of revelation. In the end, that’s what it’s all about. Address 221-222 Shoreditch High Street, London, E1 6PJ Contact Felix Finkernagel Instagram finkernagelross",

    "description": "We do not have a house style. There are no recurring visual affectations that are imposed on our work. It’s not easy to look at one of our projects and say ‘that’s a Fletcher Priest’. That’s because it’s not about us. Each project begins with a site, its context, and an open mind. We begin the design process at the end, with the people who will use the cities, buildings and spaces we design. What do those people need? What will make their lives better through our design? If we can envisage, understand and forecast their needs, we can bring that vision to life. Before we speak, we listen. Investing time to understand our client’s ambitions, the characteristics of the site, the needs of the occupants and the importance of the context is paramount. Good design does not occur in a vacuum. It takes great teams working together to realise a common goal. We communicate honestly and challenge respectfully. It’s an approach that has earned us rich, long-term relationships with some great people. Throughout the life of the practice, long before sustainability was a widespread term, we have been interested in how we can work with existing buildings and structures rather than assuming they need to be replaced. Intelligently working with the buildings we inherit can be in the best interests of our clients both economically and environmentally.

What are the characteristics that define a particular sense of place and how can that quality be reinforced? What makes a city truly sustainable? Our practice is rooted in London; a city of endless variety and interest and an ideal place to explore these questions. The buildings we design are unequivocally modern – clear and positive expressions of our age. At the same time, we want our buildings to reinforce the positive aspects of their specific locations – ultimately becoming an integral part of the context themselves. Over the years Formation Architects has designed and delivered a huge range of projects. In the process we have built up an unsurpassed experience in analysing sites for development. This ranges from individual sites to large scale masterplanning layouts. In design terms we do not push any particular agenda, instead recognising quality wherever it may be found, in the proportions of an elevation or the refinement of a detail. We are skilled at producing attractive, practical design solutions as well as presenting our work persuasively to all stakeholders including planning authorities, local residents and of course our clients.

We imagine new buildings where there are voids. We recycle bits of leftover architecture. We feel that design should be fun, ambitious and above all else empathetic. We respect the ideas of others and we like to listen. For us, Architecture is a unifying discipline - politics, regulation, location, design, finance, construction and user experience - that can maintain social and artistic concerns. It should be critical, balanced and multi-faceted with The Architect’s role being one of ‘opportunity provider’. We see an inventive approach to Design as part confrontation/part co-operation in the pursuit of strong solutions, simple construction & sensible costs. Parallel to our day to day architect-ing, fourth_space is creator of “The Negroni Talks…!” an informal, freewheeling and provocative debate series with a cafe-culture vibe. We also run Ombra, a venetian bar/restaurant a few doors down from our attic-like studio space, which functions both as our less formal ‘2nd meeting room’ and a place where we host events as a public facing extension of the practice.

Since then, our practice has grown in size and project scope, with the aim of constantly improving areas of our expertise, and where possible, beyond those boundaries, toward even broader fields. This has been achieved by consciously evolving our practice, and we've done this by placing learning, improving, and refining every aspect of what we do, at the very core of our business. This means being aware of opportunities as they arise, and being proactive in making positive change. Most visibly, it is this philosophy that led to our joining forces with Findlay Construction. We took repeated learnings from over a decade of practice, and saw that our most excellent work was realised through close relations, with our most excellent construction partners. To improve further therefore, we took the opportunity to evolve, and created our design and build offering. But it doesn't just stop there. Like evolution, the process is ongoing and underpins everything that we do, both internally and externally. From internal projects and experiments (where we burden the risks and share the rewards), to staff development and training, to client relations and project management, to finding future partners and associates that share in our plans, to learn, improve, and refine.

In 2009 we became an independent practice focussed on providing architectural services to the residential and commercial sectors, and relocated to fabulous offices in the heart of vibrant Clerkenwell. The company has developed to provide expertise within the residential sector for developers, contractors, housing associations and private individuals, and in the commercial sector for hotels, restaurants and leisure operators. We have a reputation for design led, clear, architectonic solutions, over a wide range of project sizes. Our main expertise lies in the residential sector where we have developed partnering relationships with a number of RSL, private developer and contractor clients. Our award-winning planning work includes quick accurate feasibility studies to establish viability, with imaginative and buildable design solutions. Much of our planning work is mixed-tenure or private led and we therefore clearly understand that quality and imagination delivers value.

We architect them with empathy and, through challenge, facilitation and tenacity, are able to conjure more out of the sum of their parts. This way, they can bring value far beyond the boundaries of the site. Our buildings are made to last: they are clearly configured, and in turn reconfigurable, to extend their social, environmental and heritage value. They are put together with care and economy, and refined through detail and craft. Our studio is a safe place to play, where everyone has agency and responsibility is shared. We’re bound by mutual warmth, respect and curiosity and, as a 'free haus', our minds – and studio walls – are open, liberating us to specialise and evolve. We architect fairly, to shape real lives.

    "description": "Architecture is about much more than creating a functional, built environment. The skill in creating value lies in how the design process can add to that functionality by producing great places and buildings that are beautiful, sustainable and maximise the client’s investment. Like the best art and music, the most valuable compositions are often the simplest. Great places enrich our lives and lift our spirits. We all like to live, work and play in harmonious surroundings that we feel secure in; can find our way round in, have the right scale and use natural materials. Great buildings help underpin those places. But the best ones link arms with their neighbours rather than stand out and shout. They highlight the collective place rather than the individual icon. Interventions in existing buildings and places need sensitive touches, to ensure existing value isn’t lost and to ensure new value is added, not just for the owners but for users and visitors.

In 2013 they established their own studio to create thoughtful and enduring architecture. The practice has amassed a wealth of experience, designing contemporary buildings of different scales for a variety of clients. Gibson Thornley is a design-led studio. Both directors are intimately involved in the design and realisation of every project. We apply a critical design approach to each scheme, which responds to the clients’ unique circumstances. The context of a project (economic, social, cultural) is used to stimulate and generate the architectural proposal. Each project has a set of simple and clear ideas that nourish the design as it develops. We enjoy drawing and making; testing and refining ideas through a range of diagrams, sketches and models. Our strong visual sensibility enables ideas to be critically assessed within the studio, and explored with the client and wider design team. The success of every project is based on collaborative working – we forge close relationships with the client, design team and wider stakeholders. The making and technical parameters of each project is central to our creative process. Our critical approach to design is applied to each stage and ensures that a project’s detailed development embodies our initial intent.

Our work is based on a foundation of research. This can be as simple as watching how clients use their house or as complicated as arriving at innovative technical solutions to problems that allow us to make buildings work for you. We apply this research in a collaborative way working with clients and end users to arrive at building solutions which the users are a part of. We recognise that buildings are never “complete” but will continue to change throughout their lives. We aim to building in flexibility which allows this to happen. We aim to design buildings which are simple to read, elegantly conceived and above all detailed with technical prowess and sophistication. The work of the practice is underpinned by a strong conviction in the value of creative design, not by a desire to specialise in any single sector. Our strength lies in our ability to apply a systematic design process regardless of programme or location. We apply an inclusive and collaborative approach fostering creative dialogue with clients, consultant teams, contractors and end users. We develop our designs to maximise space and light; we aspire to deliver something uplifting and unique. We seek out appropriate technologies for construction, the electrical, mechanical, ventilation and heating strategies to provide an energy efficient and long-lasting solution to every brief. As well as new build we have a strong track record of working on old and listed buildings.

While our background encompasses various typologies, including residential, commercial, cultural and educational, our work has focused predominately on the design and delivery of high quality, predominantly residential projects, from extensions and one-off houses to larger, multiple unit schemes. We find we gain energy and creativity from the challenge of working from more intimate to grander scales; it makes us better, more intuitive designers. Our fundamental ambition is to design beautiful buildings that exceed our clients’ expectations. Buildings that both delight with poetics and satisfy with functional logic and efficiency. Our influences are broad and encompass the historical, modernism and contemporary vernaculars. This enables us to find a balance between place and context and a need for characterful architectural expression. Our pursuit of timeless design fits hand in glove with our commitment to sustainability, where we always seek to give priority to the existing building, the possibility of retrofit, supporting the circular economy and the use of natural and durable materials. This is not a bolt-on, but a core part of our design process from the inception of a project. We support the need to prioritise climate change and are members of Architects Declare. We work with a range of consultants on often highly complex projects with multiple stakeholders. Our skill in negotiating these complexities has led to repeat projects with clients and ever strengthening relationships. We advocate and explain our designs as clearly as possible. We find that this helps drive our projects through an increasingly challenging and burdensome planning process. This is as true for a one-off house as it is for our larger projects. We are always delighted to discuss new projects to find out whether we can help shape your aspirations, adding architectural excellence and value.

Careful crafting of design solutions is a collaborative process informed by an understanding of client, through consultation and through research of materials and context.

Our experience has provided excellent knowledge of the planning system, and what it takes to deliver a project. We bring our diverse range of skills to each project, working with clients to establish a brief and provide a unique solution that meets, or more often than not, exceeds their expectations.

    "description": "Architecture sits uneasily in the world of design. A building is not an artefact, instrument, or garment yet it is contemplated, used and in a sense, worn. Contemporary architecture stumbles from one to another of this plurality of aspects, never sure to which it ought to cleave hardest, pulled this way and that by the prevailing fashion. Some architects bend materials to their own ideas, others let their ideas be bent by materials: either way they coerce the subject into a simplicity of their own making, subjugated to the architect’s will or talent, whichever happens to be in greater credit. We take a different approach. For us architecture must have the richness of the life it encloses: no more and no less. Just as life is polymorphous—in the philosophical jargon—so must architecture be. It is no more than life reducible to any set of abstractions, no more one thing or another. Done well, it leaves all “-isms” at the door, calls on no general principles, answers with no stock phrases. Its solutions are local, whether globally admired or not, tailored to specifics, to a here and now however long or short that might last. And, crucially, it belongs to someone other than its author, for it must be part of the people who inhabit it or else it becomes just a stage, turning the life of its occupants into a reality show without an audience. It is the client’s identity—not ours—that should be embodied in their building, the organising intelligence should stay below the surface.

    "description": "We pursue an intuitive approach that is driven by context and local culture. We develop designs that fuse buildings into their context. We aim to deliver surprising yet culturally rooted buildings that enhance the wider public realm, that create a sense of place and that engage the passer-by. We seek to distill complex problems into simple conceptual or architectural propositions. Our starting point is the understanding of the context and identifying relevant building types, new and ancient that we refine and thoroughly modernise. Our buildings inhabit a place between the familiar and the unexpected, a quality that includes and intrigues. The success of our designs entirely depend on the skill and ingenuity of our collaborators. Landscape architects, engineers, artists and craftsmen are as indispensable to the process as is the presence of a trusting client. Everyday work is devoted to delivering apparently simple and uncluttered buildings that clients can evolve over time. We want our buildings to evoke a crafted, hand made feel but to be of their time. We use generous landscape and hardy, textured materials that age with grace and evoke rich associations. Developing common sense sustainable environmental solutions is endemic to our approach because a 21st Century building can and should be a benign presence on our planet.

For us, the process of architecture is collaborative and democratic — we want clients and people who use the buildings to have a voice, and to shape the way their building ends up. We focus on specialist public-sector projects, using fresh eyes and lateral thinking to tackle varied and complex briefs. With over 30 years’ experience, we’ve designed buildings of all kinds — specialist schools and colleges, police stations and firing ranges, churches and crematoria, social housing and offices. We’re a medium-sized practice, and each job the studio takes on is led by one of our three partners. As well as the usual architectural services, we also can help out with client design advisor services, technical guidance, and design review. We’ve won our fair share of awards, but what’s more important to us is that our contribution makes a real difference in the community, and to the people who cross the threshold every day.

Ambitious projects are brain-meltingly complex.

We pay close attention to the specific chemistry of individual places and cultural situations, seeking to understand both the context and possible future life of our clients’ buildings - a process which often yields original or unconventional design solutions. As a practice and as individuals a sense of social purpose is a key driver for the work that we do. We have over 25 years’ experience of collaborating with socially driven organisations and clients who share the belief in our responsibility to create spaces for people and communities and not for the profit of the few.

During the 1980’s Haydn Bennett started to develop low energy buildings whilst working for a regional health authority. In the case of a Community Hospital, the developed design reduced the predicted energy consumption to below half of the maximum allowable under the Building Regulations at that time. Since the forming of the practice in 1990, energy reduction has been a feature of many of the projects with many new houses, extensions and conversions being significantly better than the minimum required to meet the regulations. This interest has been expanded with designing to very low energy standards including the adoption of the Passivhaus standard for most new houses and, where possible, incorporating materials with low embodied energy and from low carbon and sustainable sources.

Through our diverse portfolio, we have established a reputation for designing environments that are sensitive and sustainable, innovative and humane, and refined and delightful. We are interested in designing environments that enable and support communities, and spaces that respond inventively and pragmatically to patterns of life and physical contexts. There isn’t a ‘look’ to our projects: each design is a unique and tailored to respond to the people our projects are for, the site the space will sit in and the budget available. We are interested in landscape and materiality, and nature and domesticity and we have explored these themes through projects at every scale. From the design of a window to sit in, to the refurbishment of a space for a community, to the design of a new school and to the masterplan of part of a city. We work collaboratively with our clients and have been commissioned by a variety of public and private sector, third sector and individuals. We have an excellent record of delivering complex briefs within cost and programme constraints. We have worked with both traditional and design and build procurement routes through all RIBA stages, have led design teams and carried out the role of Lead Consultant and Contract Administration on small bespoke projects as well as complex and multi-million pound, multi-phased schemes.

    "description": "Established in 1995, Henley Halebrown has evolved from a practice working on a range of interiors, exhibitions and domestic commissions to completing award winning education, healthcare, residential, commercial and arts buildings as well as “adaptive reuse” projects. We have been named Healthcare Architect of the Year in 2008, Public Building Architect of the Year in 2011 and Housing Architect of the Year in 2021. We treat each housing project as an opportunity to think about how the buildings and spaces we construct can have a positive impact on people’s lives. From London’s first co-housing community at Copper Lane and our RIBA Stirling Prize-shortlisted student housing in Roehampton, to the RIBA Neave Brown Award-winning and Stirling Prize-shortlisted 333 Kingsland Road & Hackney New Primary School and local-authority led estate regeneration and infill projects across Hackney, to a residential tower in Hammersmith and Fulham, all these varied residential projects have the shared ambition of raising the standard of housing provision in the UK. We are currently delivering around 1600 new and refurbished homes across London. We have completed the first two phases of a scheme to regenerate the Kings Crescent estate for Hackney Council, creating a total of 262 new homes and 101 refurbished flats of mixed tenure. We are now working on the delivery of Phases 3 and 4, a scheme which will create a further 217 new and 174 refurbished homes as well as a new public square, community facilities, retail and affordable workspace. In west London, Edith Summerskill House on the post-war Clem Atlee Estate in Fulham is an 18-storey tower providing 133 social rent homes, developed by Stanhope and Peabody in a joint venture with the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham. It has been described by the Planning Inspector “an outstanding piece of design\" and a \"game changer for the quality of affordable housing\". Our housing work is characterised by a rich and durable material palette, creativity within constrained budgets, robust detailing, attractive amenity space and most importantly carefully considered, attractive homes that form the backdrop to people’s daily lives. We are passionate about delivering fantastic homes that make a wider contribution to society, and believe that the variety and quality of our housing work stands out for the way in which high minded ideas are matched by an attention to detail, construction and an understanding of what makes a good home and an attractive place to live. Our projects demonstrate the variety of our approaches to housing design. We have delivered projects which not only repair the urban fabric but also raise the quality of a new generation of social housing with a civic quality. Our sensitive approach to estate regeneration ensures that attractive new homes are complemented by the meaningful transformations of existing buildings, addressing the disparity between ’us’ and 'them’. And we have shown how mixed-use schemes can bring residential and education or commercial uses together on one site to be more than the sum of their parts, exemplary approaches to hybrid architecture.

We like to workshop with the client body to tease out nuance and discover possibilities THINKING – Each client and building is different so we do not produce ‘stock’ designs.We develop projects from first principles fitting a specific brief to a specific space. Lateral thinking is always required to ensure the suit fits perfectly MAKING – We are ‘makers’ used to fabricating our own models, prototypes and mock-ups. This gives us a good understanding of the nature of materials and develops our detailing skills DESIGNING – Concept and vision are crucial to form a narrative for the design process, pulling the threads together. The good design we strive to produce should always combine utility with delight PRESENTING – Describing the proposed design solutions in an understandable way is key to project success. We endeavour to communicate accurately and succinctly to ensure clean sign-offs DRAWING – Cost certainty and buildability rely on well produced tender and production information. Our documentation is always comprehensive and delivered to the agreed deadlines BUILDING – We prefer to stay close to the construction process as this maintains a constant learning loop.

Our deeply-rooted architectural, environmental and social convictions guide our designs and we work confidently and collaboratively in a manner appropriate to each client's needs, ambitions and budget. At the heart of the Practice's organisation are Design Teams, which are formed to take a new project from inception to completion and ensure continuity of brief and design intent. These teams are led by a Principal who collaborates on each project with leading engineers, cost-control consultants and other specialists. Experience has taught us that the best buildings come from close cooperation between ourselves, our consultants, and the client and their advisors and we approach every project with this in mind. We take great pride in our adaptability throughout the design and construction process and we have worked with varied clients ranging from individuals to city councils to Boards of Trustees to developers. We work from offices which we designed ourselves in Marylebone that house a team of approximately 100 architects and staff. In addition, we operate a second Design Studio in Dubai. The size of our practice has allowed us to gain a breadth of experience from projects in a variety of sectors while maintaining an intimate connection to the development of each design.

We undertake extensions, renovations, fit-outs and new builds where we combine sustainability with a careful analysis of the site using traditional and modern forms of construction to make practical designs fitting to their context.

We look to reinvent how buildings and structures can have a life beyond their original purpose Delight – we believe that joy is just as important as function. Seed the unexpected and create escapism through architecture Patina – imagine spaces both now and in the future; work with materials that endure, grow in character and develop patina with time and use Enrichment – architecture should be transformative for those that experience it. It should enrich the lives of its immediate users and the community & environment in which it sits. We endeavour to leave a positive legacy Many of our projects are mixed use, retrofit, located within tight urban sites, and involve Listed Buildings; all are approached with an open mind and enthusiasm to create the most appropriate response to the brief. We work towards low carbon and embrace the circular economy, reducing waste through the inventive upcycling of sites, building uses, and materials. Ours is a diverse, design-centric and democratic studio environment. We support local schools, lecture at Universities, and engage in place-making within our broader community. We actively encourage young architects from disadvantaged backgrounds and are signatories of the Waltham Forest Career Programme Pledge and Mayor of London’s Diversity Pledge.

We work across all uses, programmes and scales employing passion, free-thinking, rigour and process in our responses to brief, context, sustainability and legacy. Design Approach: Our body of work is characterised by considered placemaking, simplicity of form, elegance of proportion, contextual abstraction and material composition. Our iterative design process informs an architectural language that runs throughout our work, with differentiation between projects provided through responses to context and programme to create moments of delight in composition, ordering, reveal, entrance, crown, colour, material palette and detail. Sustainability: We believe that architects have a pivotal role to play in helping society, humanity and the planet in a time of paradigm shift. We design and research for inherent and holistic long-term sustainability. We seek only to work on projects where their siting is in proximity to public transport and where they can contribute to a walkable city. We do not see a building as being designed for a singular use. We believe that buildings can only be considered sustainable if they can be proven to be adaptable to other future uses. The enduring nature of our architecture, the rationalism on which it is based, our employment of simple form and our use of robust materiality inherently provide for adaptability and longevity of use, with the aim for permanence to mitigate future need for recycling and re-use. We believe in the long-term benefits of contextualism in providing a sense of place, identity and ownership. This is realised in our work through in-depth research of the specific conditions of a site’s geographical, climatic, historical, social and cultural context with the aim to improve the quality of experience and engagement within the city through a creative reimagining of its contextual conditions. Social Responsibility: We believe in the importance of our role in engaging communities within the profession. We have a dedicated in-house team for Equality, Diversity, Inclusion & Community to bring in new initiatives and to help us ensure that our voice of advocacy is heard through internal and external communications. Their activities include working with the community and local schools with the aim of increasing the awareness and understanding of architecture and the built environment in order to help make the profession more visible and accessible to young people from all backgrounds who might not otherwise have considered a career in architecture. Research: Continuous research is a key element in the continuous development of our practice. Our ongoing research programmes include ‘Twelve Sites’, a mapping of the city of Berlin; ‘The Death of the High Street’ looking at the densification and re-population of town centres, and and the development of the ‘Universal Building’, an adaptable building typology to ensure future longevity of use.

Communities grow and change, placing new demands upon the building’s infrastructure and spatial elements. Particularly those related to the growth of virtual communities. We have been committed to an environmentally sustainable design approach since the practice was established in 1981 and deliver buildings that not only come in below budget but are easy and safe to use and maintain. Our projects testify to our philosophy not to waste, and to construct buildings that optimise carbon-free energy and minimise energy bills. Since 1990, we have sought to use materials and products that use less energy in their manufacture and use and which require little or no maintenance. We are very proud of our reputation in achieving and maintaining a 100% record in securing planning permissions with the first application. This is achieved through early and constructive rapport with local authorities, consultative bodies, local communities, and residents, and through the quality of our designs and documentation. It began in 1978, the Fluy House, France, a £30,000 self-built solar-powered, 300m² for £30,000, followed by Eagle Rock House, UK, for £80,000, in 1981, also partially self-built and solar-powered, through to a residential-led scheme in Covent Garden in November 2013, and the latest planning permission for 254 units on Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) at Lower Sydenham in 2021.

Affordability, diversity, and an increasingly vital commitment to sustainability inform all our decisions. We must be considerate of culture, aware of our citizen’s needs, and always kind to nature.

We believe in the value of powerful ideas that are embedded in the built form regardless of its scale. Our design emerges from close examination of the site’s qualities and its context whilst creating a contemporary and sustainable building embodying high quality design and craftsmanship. Our aim is always to deliver projects on budget and on time without compromising on the quality of the design by ensuring a methodical dialogue with our clients, stakeholders and collaborators. We focus on creating architectural solutions that not only respond sensitively to the site and the environment, but also are innovative, practical and delightful. Ultimately, every building we create is designed to make people’s life better. We continually explore the boundaries of the profession of architecture within the broader context, which has motivated us to work beyond the traditional practice model by collaborating with other creative and commercial industries. This has allowed us to be proactively engaged and involved architecturally in the complete process of creating and making buildings. We have been inspired to think laterally, which continues to enrich our experiences within a multifaceted practice.

    "description": "n underlying agenda stems from long standing scientific interests. In the context of current overwhelming pressures on the planet's environment, there is an increasingly urgent need for architects to understand and embrace the doubt and uncertainty inherent to science in general (and quantum mechanics in particular), as well as the logical, rational enquiry and mathematical truth at the base of the scientific method. Combining artistic and scientific concerns, architecture has always been a discipline that bridges the ‘two cultures’. In our era of unprecedented and accelerating change driven by technology, the fundamental concerns of architecture remain unchanged. These involve the design of sculptured social space for improved quality of life, animated by light, of durable construction with appropriate use of technology, environmental responsibility and sensual materiality, with a connectedness to place, all combining to give an emotional charge. The best buildings are a backdrop to peoples lives, that still subtly engender a sense of wonder and delight (400 years of scientific investigation only adds to the same wonder at nature, when we look at, and understand, the stars or a flower). To remain relevant, contemporary architecture, like all art, must also continually evolve new forms that reflect the present and lead us into the future. In order to respond to the changes we will experience this century, this requires architecture to incorporate a working knowledge of current science and mathematics (which in underpinning new technology, as well as being the best method of understanding the world, form the dominant intellectual discourse).

    "description": "The practice was established by James Dunnett in 1983 and he continues to be the principal designer and to be closely involved in every stage of every project. The aim in every project is to meet the client’s brief precisely while creating spaces that fully meet the objectives of ‘Light, Space, Greenery’ – spaces that are harmonious and a joy to experience and live in and around, while meeting their functional purpose. In residential projects the objective wherever possible is to optimize the relationship between house and garden. While having a profound love of historic architecture and a close interest in its conservation, he has never felt that this was sufficient by itself, because the quality of our future environment will inevitably depend largely on what we build now, how we meet our own needs. So the creation of new structures of quality has to go hand in hand with conservation of the best of the past. James Dunnett has as a result made a close study of the history and theory of the architecture and urbanism of the last hundred years – research reflected in the texts forming part of this website – to understand why we are where we are in architecture, to pick up on the best in it while identifying its shortcomings, and to move forward to new creation on the basis of understanding. As a long-standing member of the Green Register he recognises that the need radically to reduce the stress placed on the natural environment by rapidly rising levels of human consumption calls for a new chapter in the development of architectural form.

We achieve this by embracing an open, interactive design process that responds positively to the needs and aspirations of the people we work with. By allowing the process to drive the project, we have built a portfolio of inventive projects, each of which makes the most of the unusual opportunities and particular challenges of its site context. Our method stimulates innovative design, and always seeks to add benefits through education, economic growth, cultural activity or greater community coherence. We believe that an integrated approach is needed for any place to fulfil its potential. This conviction has led us to work across sectors, including regeneration, housing, economic development, education, public space and planning. In each field, our projects are united by their public purpose. For us, sustainability is more than just a technological challenge. By engaging a broad community in frank and open conversation from the outset of a project, we can work to ensure that our proposals are needed, useful and proportionate. Throughout design, procurement and delivery, we look for opportunities to re-activate existing spaces, use reclaimed or surplus materials and tap into local supply networks. Looking ahead, we are researching how the spaces we design and the strategies we develop can accommodate change, through flexible design strategies to demountable construction techniques. Sustainability must be a shared pursuit, and we hope to inspire others through our work. Our approach has been recognised by numerous national and international design awards. We are aware that design excellence is a team effort, and invest ourselves in our work and our professional relationships. We have ISO 9001 (Quality Assurance) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) certification which is independently verified annually. We are a London Living Wage employer.

We believe that buildings should be underpinned by a powerful idea; that the idea should be an intelligent and logical response to functionality and a sense of place; and the power of that idea should be embedded in the built form. That way, clients get the buildings they need and society gets the architecture it deserves. We believe that the city is one of humanity's most impressive and precious cultural achievements. We also believe that cities are about connections, transport, communications, public spaces and joy. We believe in locating our buildings firmly within their contexts – not as slavish repetition but as a considered response to site, materiality, amenity, scale and culture. We do not believe in the value of a house style; if we have a house style it is one of process, not of form. We are functionalists. We believe a good building is an expression of a clear and rational diagram. We are not idly blown by the winds of fashion. We believe in the value of research. We believe in contemporary design for a changing world.

The practice works on a range of residential, commercial and civic projects providing full architectural, interior design and masterplanning services for both public and private sectors. Our range of completed projects includes hotels, private houses, residential developments, offices, retail, transport and the extension and conversion of historic buildings. Our design is based on a consistent approach rather than a particular style with each scheme a unique response to site, context and our clients brief. We aim to achieve simple, elegant and practical solutions through intensive discussion with our clients and consultant team. Many of our projects involve the insertion of new uses within complicated urban sites and often have difficult planning histories. We pride ourselves on creating an imaginative and sensitive architectural response which is borne out in our success in achieving planning consent and the quality of our built work. We typically work on a small number of projects at any one time. This allows for great continuity and personal involvement. Unlike many practices, we have a policy of a single project architect following each scheme through from the first meeting to detail design, construction and completion. The practice director is involved in all stages of the design and attends all client and design team meetings in tandem with the project architect. We believe this structure has allowed us to develop strong, long term relationships with our clients and enhance the rigorous quality of our completed buildings.

    "description": "K Bava Architects is a design-focused studio in London. Since its inception in 2018, K Bava Architects has concentrated on building a body of innovative and inspiring architectural design. We offer a variety of services including architecture, urban design, interior design and conservation work. We have extensive knowledge of working with historic and listed buildings. Our clients are diverse: from individual homeowners and shops to major cultural organisations and high-end developers. We have demonstrated an approach to resolving client ambitions and project complexities into a tactile architecture of atmosphere, material and detail. We resolve complex combinations of existing elements into an architecture, which in its totality feels well balanced and comfortable. The practice is experienced with complex clients and is currently undertaking a number of projects for the Victoria and Albert Museum. The residential projects range from low to high budgets. The approach to each situation is unique with some projects displaying a rich and complex design, whilst others take a calm and understated method to meet the client’s needs. Our retail design work has provided great opportunity to experiment with small-scale semi-public work. We aim to capture the essence of each brand to create a physical embodiment of their values on display to their customers.

Our team understands the tough challenges faced by local communities, setting out to adapt, repair and replace what doesn’t work with ambitious designs for homes and places that do, whilst evolving and refining housing and building types with each scheme. We employ an extremely talented team of architects who are passionate about housing design and making remarkable buildings and places. We work with clients and specialist partners in a fully collaborative way to deliver these qualities, orchestrating expert consultants and collaborators and fully engaging with local residents and wider stakeholders from the earliest stages of the design process. This ensures grassroots involvement, support and a sensitive approach to decant and phasing. Our approachable design workshops, large-scale models, sketches and presentations help communicate our schemes to residents and stakeholders in an informed but grounded manner, including them in the creation of homes and places that residents of all tenures are proud to call home.

Questioning, pushing boundaries, stimulating and reinterpreting in order to establish a brief that has the correct ‘fit’ within a broadly considered context. The resulting brief generates a diagrammatic framework of rationality and fantasy which is used to structure the design. Where the conceptual framework is rigorous and robust it can inform every level of the design down to the last detail so as to produce a pure, coherent and legible result. Good design enriches life. At every scale from a city to a light-fitting; design can improve the quality of our environment. Architecture is a dynamic and evolving art.

We specialise in sustainable design that improves well-being. We are a thoughtful, pragmatic and creative team of problem-solvers. We love to explore how people live, learn and play. We offer full architectural services, and can tailor our services to meet our clients’ needs. We help land owners (or prospective land owners) understand the potential of a site and the added value that can be bought to it through a small or mid-sized residential development. We can help with viability studies by quickly appraising the potential built area and arrangements that can fit on a plot; and go on to design and deliver high quality, sustainable homes. We design developments that are appropriate in scale, massing and character in relation to the context. This approach to place-making can help achieve planning permission in sensitive locations. We are interested in re-interpreting traditional typologies in contemporary ways. We can help our clients deliver homes that are inclusive, relevant and desirable for modern life. We are particularly valued for our involvement at the very early stages of a project to help define the right brief, appraise options and set a firm bedrock for the project. Each project has its own story formed through considering the PEOPLE, PLACE and PLANET. PEOPLE: We start with people. Our designs are generated by how we understand people will use the spaces. This can produce solutions that haven’t yet been anticipated. We build in flexibility so the building can adapt and grow, which also gives the project long term value for money. PLACE: We understand a building doesn’t exist in a vacuum, but in a physical and environmental context. It should have a meaningful conversation with its surroundings. This doesn’t mean the architecture needs to blend in – it can be respectful as well as bold and brave. PLANET: We aim to create responsible buildings. Embedded within all our designs is the ambition to make genuinely sustainable, accessible and inclusive projects, and we have in-house expertise to achieve this.

We safeguard that heritage by ensuring it is resilient, sustainable, and accessible – in essence – making heritage fit for the future. Heritage can be found at all scales – townscapes, country houses, churches, houses, and street monuments. It can also be built (tangible) or based on traditions (intangible). No matter the size or status we support those responsible for its stewardship. We work for people and organizations that see the value of heritage and want to invest to restore and adapt for greater benefit. Couples and families looking to move into a new home or wanting to refresh their current home. Heritage can sensitively adapt to change and should not be a barrier to families at key life changes. Creating a home can be a response to change and an opportunity to reflect the status and values of the owners. We are particularly able to support creative couples with busy professional and family lives. We take our enthusiasm for heritage and couple it with the professional services of a RIBA Chartered Practice and Conservation Accredited Architect. We remove the barriers homeowners can encounter to adapting or renewing their homes as well as reducing risks associated with an important investment. By providing a service from the first idea until they are comfortably settled in their renewed home, we provide a level of guardianship along the way focused on their needs. We assemble an expert team of designers, trades and contractors focusing on providing high standards of service and care. We actively research and train staff in technical and design developments so that we can provide the most up-to-date services and leading expert knowledge.

His first commission for a new dwelling was within a large garden of an existing semi-detached, Victorian house in Llanishen, Cardiff. In a rare twist of fate, although the new owners at the time were unaware, this house had been Chris' family home for the first eighteen years of his life. With the sound benefit of a thorough understanding of the plot, the resulting house responded very successfully to its setting, subsequently receiving the Lord Mayor's Civic Award in 1992 for the 'Best Example of an Individual House or Extension'.

For the past 27 years we have worked at almost every scale on many types of building in every sector - from individual houses to social and private housing schemes, cultural and commercial projects, new-buildings and renovations. We have expertise and deep interest in heritage and conservation design, and extensive academic and professional experience of working with listed buildings and in conservation areas. We have won a number of awards including The Royal Fine Art Commission's Building Beauty Little Gem award for Westminster Coroner's Court in 2024, and best office building at The World Architecture Festival in 2016. Publishers regularly feature our work in architectural journals across the world. Marsh View, a house that we crafted out of parts of a 1950s Norfolk bungalow between 2003-8, was described in The Observer by Stephen Bailey, as \"masterpiece\", and Ellis Woodman, the director of the Architecture Foundation, observed in the Architects Journal in 2016 that \"Lynch Architects' buildings at Victoria should see us all out.\" We were privileged to exhibit our work at the Venice Biennale in 2008 and in 2012, and at the Milan Triennial in 2018. Our finished buildings looks remarkably similar to the CGIs made of them early in the design process, because we believe in the craft of architecture, and that good design entails editing and refinement, what might be called the search for a poetic economy of means. As well as teaching and a commitment to working with teenagers within our community, we run a small publishing house from within the practice, Canalside Press, which publishes the Journal of Civic Architecture (JoCA) as well as books on the history of modern architecture, photography and poetry.

Among other high-profile clients is the Royal Court Theatre, described by the New York Times as \"the most important theatre in Europe\". Our award-winning design for the theatre won the Royal Court a place among The Stage's top ten theatrical hangouts. Our designs are transformative: taking a deeply analytical approach, we invent or re-imagine our clients’ assets to make them more successful. The buildings we create promote resilient and diverse communities, shaping our cities, towns and villages to be thriving and sustainable, and making homes, shops, civic and workspaces places to enjoy. At the heart of our studio’s work is a commitment to finding innovative design solutions that are imaginative, pragmatic and add value and delight. We place great importance not only on how buildings look, but on their construction, the way materials are used and how they age. Our values include working closely with our clients and forging long-term relationships, seeing projects through from beginning to end, collaborating with engineers, builders and craftspeople and developing our designs from an intimate understanding of context. We always strive to harness the unique character of a place to create something apt yet audacious.

    "description": "MBA specialise in new buildings and alterations in highly sensitive environments. We employ a conservation approach: changes to a place are based on evidence-based understanding of setting, history and significance. Our aim is to achieve sustainable use of buildings and sites to achieve best value in cultural, environmental and economic terms. Since MBA’s foundation in 1991 we have worked in highly protected sties including many Oxford Colleges, Grade I listed buildings, Conservation Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Scheduled Monuments in and around London and the south east, as well as regeneration projects centred on heritage assets across the UK. What distinguishes MBA is a research-based approach to conservation coupled with imaginative cutting-edge design. We often succeed where other practices have failed. There is no ‘house style’. Each work is developed to suit the particular circumstances of the project. We are expert at community consultation and dialogue with local and national authorities. We think beyond ‘how will it look’ to ‘what will it feel like’ to live in, because architecture comes alive with inhabitation. Our work is energy efficient, popular in use and sustainable. It ranges from small scale interventions in listed buildings through medium sized new build projects, to larger scale urban developments.

We seek to create places that are engaging and stimulating, but also comfortable both in form and function.

Our studio is located among a community of designers, artists and makers, and we benefit from being part of this environment.

We aspire to a different type of practise; where craftspeople can have a long-term role in the evolution of our studio.

We regularly work with listed buildings, and many of our projects are within sensitive contexts, both urban and rural; Conservation Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

We care about sustainability; reinventing and renewing while striving to minimise reliance on new materials and their associated embodied carbon. Through thoughtful design, we maximise what’s already there to improve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint. Our approach blends bold originality, playful curiosity and local sensitivity. Where others come with answers, we ask, listen and learn - challenging assumptions and questioning ‘cemented truths’. Through this process of creative exploring and experimenting, we find the best way - not just the expected way. Every decision and design is made to simplify, improve and enrich the way you live. This comes from taking the time to understand you, your lifestyle and your built environment. Then we work side-by-side with you at every stage, turning your ideas and ambitions into a unique home that feels like you and fills you with joy.

We approach each commission as a distinct narrative, developing designs with sketches and models to create bespoke solutions that satisfy practical demands and bring joy to our clients. Following the successful completion of several private commissions, we completed our first commercial project in 2020 - the refurbishment and extension of 4,000 sqm of office space. We are now working on a diverse portfolio of projects ranging from residential refurbishments to co-work fit-outs, the restoration of an historic covered market and our first large scale new build starting on site in West London. On all projects we seek to add value and provide realistic and effective solutions. We work closely with our clients to ensure projects are delivered on time and to budget.

Our clients include commercial developers, charities, local authorities and private individuals; projects range from private houses and public installations to new schools and RIBA accredited Client Advisory services for large-scale local authority projects. Dynamic and design led, we have built our reputation on flexibility and an ability to respond imaginatively to the individual circumstances of our clients. Central to this approach is our experience in facilitating dialogue with all of a project’s participants. We put the needs of users first, working from the inside out, whilst maintaining a pragmatic and practical approach. We are pragmatic, intelligent designers who recognise the reality of operating to limited budgets and tight schedules and the necessity for fast-paced work in today’s competitive, commercial environment. We work collaboratively with a wide range of world class consultants and contractors to deliver our projects. As a smaller practice MSA are also able to offer clients a much higher level of input and supervision from senior staff throughout the course of a project, from brief to completion on site. MSA’s ambition is to craft fine, innovative buildings which meet and exceed the needs of clients and end-users, with exemplary professionalism, sustainability and quality.

    "description": "There is vast accrued property and construction industry knowledge in McBains, more than our size might suggest. We're accessible, flexible, ego-free, and highly conscious it's all about you and what you want. We're flattered to be sought-out by clients and partners, who, in collaborating with us in often long-term relationships, recognise our drive and passion to evolve and advance the way our industry operates and delivers while accurately addressing those wants. We continually interrogate the environment in which we work to find the better way. And we keep on finding answers. Usually simple ones. While beauty in simplicity is a well-worn phrase, we wear it very well. We find simplicity, and the better way, by understanding the businesses and organisations with whom we work, how they think and operate, the specific requirements they have, and by doing what our clients need rather than what we think they want. Why our business operates in this way, and succeeds as a consequence, is down to a long-standing element of our approach: we replace complexity with that simplicity. We use the intelligence with which our highly-qualified people are bestowed. Simplicity and intelligence are effective partners. Simplicity provides the breathing space to think clearly. Clear thinking allows intelligence to be deployed more effectively. Address 26 Finsbury Square, London, EC2A 1DS Contact Mark Leeson Twitter @McBainsLtd",

Their shared interests lie in the often oppositional, overlapping and mutually beneficial elements of architecture & landscape architecture and borrowing approaches from each discipline to establish renewed design & practice methodology towards a common goal. Both Stefanie & Colin are inspired to challenge the constraints and redefine the potential of each project, no matter the size and work in close collaboration with clients, contractors and consultants in order to maintain a truly hands-on approach.

The practice changed its name from MacCormac Jamieson Prichard in June 2008 and has been owned by an Employee Benefit Trust since October 2007. We specialise in projects on sensitive sites involving delicate planning negotiations and high quality design to achieve consent. Our buildings do not have a recognisable style ‘signature’, although they share spatial, formal and technical themes, particularly an interest in historical precedents and an innovative approach to structure and the use of materials. Every project is run by small, highly motivated teams led by a director or associate. We see design as a critical iterative process subject to continuous development and evaluation. This process is maintained through regular design review involving all members of the office, encouraging objectivity, constructive appraisal and knowledge transfer. The open plan layout of our offices and the non-hierarchical structure of the practice promotes an awareness amongst staff of the development of each project and a shared aspiration to achieve excellence.

Our working methods rely on a rigorous, analytical, design-led process that is continually informed by our collaborations and the director’s academic research. We engage with projects through careful observation and studies of context, history, social patterns, sustainability and latent potential to recover value though the design of new buildings and the transformation of existing structures.

The studio has at its core work and parallel research in defining and providing designs addressing decay and obsolescence of existing buildings and urban forms. Studies into the life cycle of material systems, buildings, urban forms and their social, physical and economic components inform our understanding of the metabolism of the city.

We believe our clients share our view that excellence in architecture requires a profound respect for the past, an acute awareness of the present, and the ability to anticipate the demands of the future. As a London practice we frequently work on constrained, urban sites; often in conservation areas or within the curtilage of listed buildings. In every case our aim is to complement and enhance the existing condition; to consider not just our site but the wider context and our civic responsibilities. We appreciate, and never ignore, the economic, social and financial pressures which drive construction. Effective and open communication is an essential part of the architectural design process and is exceptionally important to our practice. We strive to stay at the forefront of 3D visualization and production information technology to aid and enhance collaboration between all parties. This rapport encourages an open-minded and varied approach to design, resulting in work which is consistent in quality, but not uniform in style. Buildings can be exuberant or restrained, colourful or quiet. They represent our creative interpretations of the objectives, values and aspirations of our clients. We design for a sustainable future, whether reusing existing buildings or making new architecture. Our aim is to create buildings that respect the environment, the needs of our clients and the wellbeing of occupants.

We enjoy thinking through the possibilities – the light, the materials, the texture, the context – and making these into your home. We form generous spaces out of ideas, light out of darkness, and friends out of clients. But we know, even before we meet you, that your project will be unlike any other. Our process is one of listening, understanding, and responding, and our conversation with you will shape the home we create together. Our designs have won awards and been featured in magazines, newspapers and on TV. We have experience of creating new houses from scratch, of adding new spaces to old houses, and of making old buildings fresh and beautiful again. We work across the UK, in towns and in the countryside, and our approach means that every building respects its context, belongs to its surroundings, and is sustainable to its core. There’s a delightful moment in every project when all the carefully considered details, all the decisions both small and large, finally come together. Complex structures give way to simplicity, sophisticated solutions give way to subtlety, and spaces flow seamlessly into one another. That’s the moment we’ll be working towards from the start, and it’s at that moment that you’ll know your home is everything you wanted it to be – and more.

    "description": "We are award-winning RIBA architects based in London that use the principles of Game Theory to design buildings. Game Theory is the mathematical study of decision-making between people in situations of conflict or cooperation. So that means any time a decision is to be made between 2 or more people, whether negotiation is involved or not, you can use Game Theory to help identify which is the best decision or strategy to take. And because we are all constantly making strategic decisions in both our professional and personal lives, most of the time without even realising it, the application of Game Theory is huge. Mzo Tarr Architects use the precise framework and mathematical tools of Game Theory as an alternative to gaining an insight into a person’s decision and reasoning. This different approach identifies alternative opportunities as well as problems, directly driving the design and function of our buildings. For example, by listing all potential choices available to those affected by a project and by quantifying the potential benefits (payoffs) to each party in making those choices, we are able to identify the best decision (best response) for an individual or parties. Game Theory informs our design process as we navigate between the many interested parties to give our clients what they want, often involving planners, neighbours, investors, even market conditions. Our buildings also continue to use Game Theory after they are built, as they respond to the lives and decisions of their occupants. Visit our Pursuit project as an example of how. We have applied this approach to +150 projects all over the world. These range from art installations to towers.

We put a strong emphasis on the inventive use of building materials, the qualities of light and the relationship between the building and its surroundings. We consider these issues to be more important than working in a particular style and hope that each project will be an original interpretation of the client, site, brief and budget. This practice does not specialise in particular building types. We consider our specialism to be high quality architecture and enjoy having a broad range of projects in the office; from town master plans, to schools, health centres, community buildings, group housing, private residential houses, exhibitions, furniture and bandstands. For us, practice is understood as a range of activities which are all necessary to each other – design of buildings, fittings and furniture; making buildings, installations and models; connecting speculation and practice, lecturing and writing about architecture; collaborations with craftsmen, artists and consultants. We use a great range of materials in our building projects. We enjoy it most when we inventively combine traditional and new construction techniques. We relish unexpected juxtapositions. All of our designs are discussed with the makers, not just in terms of performance, but also as aesthetic propositions. A good builder generally has a good eye. The work shown here is less interested in the expression of technology by bolts, junctions and gaskets, more in the overall presence of a space. In particular the way in which materials alter space by modulating light; combing it, diffusing it, storing it, reflecting it, dulling it or changing its speed.

Through a commitment to this understanding, and a process of demanding design selection, clear goals can be established by the architect and client in order to produce a joint project vision. With wisely managed project programmes and clear cost control Nick Baker Architects are committed to the creation of architectural quality. Our method of working is based on collaborative consideration. Models, 3D renderings, animations and hand sketches are critical tools of the language of communication, each serving to demonstrate the evolution of a design.

In the housing sector, we have worked across a wide range of interesting typologies, from the 167-apartment Sterling Gardens scheme in Berkshire to the ultra - eco Hartdene Barns development, a stunning collection of nine new homes, set within forty acres of land within an ANOB. Practice Director Jim Richards is also a Conservation Architect and well-versed in handling complex listed and heritage refurbishment projects, such as the redevelopment of Grange Hall in London, converting a former school building for residential use.

Since this time, we have developed a diverse client base and realised a broad range of projects covering a variety of scales and functions. As a practice, we are wholly interested in the realisation of contemporary architecture, responding to various social and cultural influences by focusing on the latent possibilities inherent in each project. We approach each design exercise as a collaborative effort, one that demands an intimate understanding of both Client and Brief before the design process can begin. By working this closely with our Clients, we hope to instil a sense of curiosity and excitement, stimulating a response and confronting some of the more restrictive prejudices and traditional preconceptions of contemporary architecture. As designers, we aspire to a simplicity distilled from a core concept, itself a product of both brief and site. We work to develop these concepts with an honesty and transparency and through the careful arrangement and detailing of materials, this process culminates in the creation of specifically detailed structures with a clear relationship to their specific context. In recent years we have grown our practice outside of Ireland, opening offices in both London and New York and currently we are developing a number of projects in the UK and Portugal.

    "description": "We are an architecture practice that works with a 50:50 split of public clients and private clients on individual homes, new build housing, and public realm projects. Office S&M specialise in infill housing on small sites. As leaders in this field, we have input on the development of Croydon’s small sites policy, which our project Valetta House is featured as an exemplar in; then workshopped Tower Hamlets’ small sites policy, which our project Salmen House is featured as an exemplar in; and most recently commented on the Lewisham small sites policy during two workshops. More recently, we have reflected on the published small sites policy in the London Plan, run talks to discuss delivery on small sites, and presented our advice to Urban Design London as an expert in this area. The practice engages clients and users in a collaborative process, experimenting with colours and materials to deliver joyful and unexpected private spaces and public places.

The studio formed through our shared passion of exploring the role of making in design. Our design approach is hands-on; testing ideas, materials and their assembly through physical models, prototypes and full-scale mock ups. We work across disciplines to encompass product design, interior design and architecture in one studio, applying the same thought and consideration that goes into designing architecture to that of interiors and products at the 1:1 scale. Our ambition is to make objects and spaces that are thoughtful and well-crafted offering our clients creative yet simple solutions. To achieve this, we collaborate with an extensive range of craftsmen who share our passion for combining traditional crafts with bespoke modern detailing. Since its inception, the studio is now a team of 5, and has developed a growing portfolio of private commissions within the residential and commercial sectors as well as pursuing our own self-initiated projects.

Our buildings respond sensitively to their context but remain unquestionably of their time. We aim to confront design problems in innovative ways and promote extensive dialogue and careful interaction between clients, consultees, fellow consultants, local residents and contractors. We actively include both local and national authorities in all stages of the design and construction process. This search for inclusion creates an architecture of tangible places of character. Many of our projects have been realised in sensitive historic settings and this has engendered a way of thinking that is rooted in understanding context in its broadest sense – we use this as a starting point for the creative process for all our projects. It is through our understanding of context that we can ensure that the decisions that are made throughout each project remain relevant to the brief. For example, housing projects designed with the home as the primary focus; uncompromisingly functional retail schemes to ensure viablity over the long term; cultural buildings which illuminate their context; masterplans with an absolute sense of place from the outset.

We practice a process of site specific investigation which questions our perception of accepted conventions in architecture. In developing physically and socially sustainable buildings, we take a holistic view of each project. Our approach to design is informed by our role in helping each client to develop a clear and logical brief. The final result should reflect the clarity of the design concept but also delight.

We offer a full range of architectural services from site feasibility through planning, building regulations and listed building consents to administration of the building contract. We can also tailor our services to your needs, offering a bespoke set of services to suit your project. PCA is committed to the delivery of timeless high-quality architecture. Working in partnership with our clients we aim to make buildings that are responsive to the project brief, site constraints and the wider local context. We also recognise the importance of a sustainable response to each brief that matches our client’s aspirations. Research shows that good design adds economic value in addition to promoting a sense of wellbeing and social value. PCA are therefore committed to intelligent design that not only maximises the value of a site or building but that is also pragmatic, functional and improves the quality of life for its users. When measured over the lifetime of a building good design need not cost more and we are always mindful of the budget constraints of any project. Our extensive experience with both private and commercial clients as well as contractors has also taught us the importance of clear communication between all parties for the delivery of successful projects.

The practice enjoys transforming existing buildings for new uses as well as delivering innovative and site-specific new build projects. By juxtaposing traditional architectural styles with modern interventions we produce sensitive but powerful designs that compliment their context.

Most of PBA’s work nowadays is residential, ranging from small rear extensions to listed building refurbishments to new-build houses and flats, and in value from £25,000 or less up to £1 million and more. Other work in the last ten years has included hospital extension and modernisation schemes (some with Grade I and II listed buildings), a sculpture studio at an art school, and shops and offices. In design terms, PBA aims for what is simple and direct in ways that allow depth and subtlety to be discovered over time.

The Studio enjoys long-standing relationships with ambitious clients including Argent, Stanhope, British Land, Derwent London and The Crown Estate. Our residential work is purposefully diverse in scale and budget. From bespoke one-off houses to large multi-residential buildings and masterplans, our work aims to create places that people feel good in. We approach this at both the micro - a human centred approach to spatial planning and material selection - and at the macro - buildings that connect with their specific architectural, cultural and environmental contexts. We are committed to making sustainable and long-lived buildings, believing that the very qualities which make a building resilient over the long term are also those that make a home feel good to live in. Current projects include 72 social housing apartments on the King’s Cross masterplan at Plot R8; 200 new homes at Paddington Green for Berkeley Group; and 160 homes across two residential towers at Camden Goods Yard. We are also working as part of a six architect team reimagining the former Olympic Park site at East Wick and Sweetwater, designing 300 homes to include market, private rented and affordable tenures with a mix of terraces and apartments. The studio recently completed two buildings for the RIBA award winning Barts Square masterplan in London’s Smithfield Conservation Area with a mix of residential and retail. In 2023 the 110 person studio became an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT). Address Centro Building, 39 Plender Street, London, NW1 0DT Contact Stuart Piercy Twitter @PiercyCo Instagram piercyco",

Over the past five decades we have built up an enviable track-record working with communities, local authorities and commercial clients to create buildings and places people want to live in. Using the full range of skills at our disposal, from architectural and urban design to masterplanning, property development and community engagement, our team of 120 professionals are dedicated to enhancing the towns, cities and villages in which we work. And while we have the resources and financial strength of a large practice we are able to offer a personal service more commonly associated with smaller studios. We understand the specific needs of our clients and where and what they seek to build: in short, as our award-winning project portfolio shows, we understand how sustainable placemaking works. We are equally comfortable tackling smaller bespoke building projects as we are masterplanning villages, towns and urban districts. We handle all stages of a project from concept and planning to delivery and post-occupancy evaluation. Our approach is founded on placing people first, understanding their needs and designing to suit, emphasising not only the way the buildings and places look, but also on how they are made, how they are used and how they age too. As well as designing new neighbourhoods and estates we also repair and revitalise existing ones in need of care. This in turn has helped us build a reputation for taking over difficult projects which have stalled and re-energising them to create thriving places people enjoy being in. We have recently completed a comprehensive remodelling of our spacious studios at Diespeker Wharf, a converted factory in Islington and a local landmark, to facilitate hybrid working and provide an outstanding venue for client meetings and industry events. We’ve earned the respect of our peers too, winning more than 250 awards over the years, with recent wins including BD Housing Architect of the Year 2017, AJ Sustainable Practice of the year in 2018 and British Homes Awards Architect of the Year 2020. As a Limited Liability Partnership PTE is controlled by eight equity partners and guided by a council of partners and senior managers.

    "description": "We are an award winning practice of architects, masterplanners, urban designers, place makers, problem solvers, researchers, artists and visualisers. We have over 30 years experience with an international portfolio that stretches across a broad range of sectors. Our approach is underpinned by an overarching commitment to imaginative design that responds to the specific cultural and social contexts of each project. We design places that are adaptable to change in order to create sustainable environments with both present and future needs in mind. We understand that collaboration achieved through a process of open communication and sharing of information is key to the success of every project no matter how large or small. A well organised and structured yet fluid process allows for input from the wider design team at any point during design development. As a practice we constantly push ourselves to improve our own methods of working. Not only do we consistently self-review our own processes, but also strongly support the continued professional development of each of our staff. We deliver our projects using BIM enabled software and continually update our quality control procedures to ensure we are up to date with industry best practice and standards. Each of our projects is reinforced by our own continuous research in analysing and understanding historical contexts, emerging social patterns and sustainable technologies. Our practice has contributed towards many exhibitions and conferences both locally and internationally, as well as design advisory panels and university teaching appointments worldwide.

Years of big practice experience, brought to a small and progressive office, allows us to provide a complete design service with a creative but discerning outlook. We are a friendly open-minded architectural practice with an experienced and energetic team undertaking projects throughout the UK. With a strong background of working across a range of project types, we specialise in London based residential new-builds, refurbishments and extensions of varying budgets. Designing architecture that is rich in detail and comprehensive in its vision requires skills beyond the conventional role of the architect. We design interiors, installations and furniture solutions, and collaborate successfully with various makers, local crafts people and niche consultants. Built-in furniture, including kitchens, bathrooms and custom storage solutions, are an integral part of the services we offer. John and Mike both undertake their own development projects and understand the careful balance required to create a fantastic project whilst maximising the value of their clients investment. Understanding the relationship between value and quality is central to the work we do and at the forefront of our thinking on every project we develop.

Based in Simon’s life-long home of Chichester, West Sussex, Randell Design Group was born as a holistic lifestyle firm to help our clients realise their dreams. We have grown to a talented team of like-minded designers from around the globe all under one roof. Address Martins Barn, Birdham Road, Chichester, PO20 7BX",

We believe that the best buildings are derived not only from outstanding creativity and design, but also from great teamwork. Central to this is an open and inclusive working methodology in which our role is to both listen and to lead the design team. We believe that good design enriches our environment and our lives and that it should be accessible to everyone. We are passionate about the craft of building and seek delight and beauty in detail and innovation. This is underpinned by considerable technical expertise and a commitment to sustainability in all its forms – environmental, social and economic. Many of our projects deal with listed buildings, conservation areas and sensitive landscapes. We enjoy the challenges and opportunities that these bring and recognise the value that existing structures have in our cultural memory and the part they play in a low-carbon future.

Architecture is experienced emotionally, felt through the skin as much as viewed through the eyes. For this reason, since Sean founded the studio in 2011, there has been a strong focus equally on the physicality of their work as on its conception. Our work is informed by an awareness of place and context, craft and materiality, local climate, inclusion of sustainability, a consideration of form, and an understanding of the simplicity and quality of well-made buildings. We approach every project as a unique and singular opportunity. Through discussion, observation and research, informed by our considerable project experience, we engage in a critical investigation of each project’s needs and constraints – with the objective of delivering the highest level of design quality, and buildings which are practical, inspiring and beautiful. Our work is also characterised by a rigorous and analytical approach to function and planning, and a thorough process of refinement which is applied to every detail.

We enjoy a wide range of client and project types and celebrate the diversity that each new commission brings. We are deliberately inquisitive and seek to understand the complexities and subtleties of the brief, the opportunities to uncover richness in the project narrative and to see between and beyond the lines of text. Our designs encourage a positive relationship between building users and the natural and built environment. We want everyone who interacts with our buildings to delight in using them. We care how our office runs and encourage all staff to engage with design and become stakeholders in the process. We provide a personal service with an emphasis on project continuity, drawing on collective experience and understanding.

We are dedicated to producing high-quality and inventive designs - not as a means of producing architectural ‘statements’ as such, but through a belief that the ability to produce innovative and beautiful work emerges from the interplay between content, context, and a sensitivity towards client requirements. An in-house workshop allows us to create hand crafted models and other three dimensional material throughout the design process to explore our design ambition and demonstrate our thinking. We are a design-led practice, and we enjoy this process - a fact that is conveyed in the rigorous level of detail and research invested in all of our projects. The practice has earned a reputation for delivering a high level of finishes and quality of workmanship. This is achieved through time spent detailing and prototyping our designs. We were selected in 2016 as one of the ‘Emerging Practices’ published in New Architects 3 by the Architecture Foundation.

They work collaboratively and enjoy a process that values ongoing conversations with clients, colleagues, consultants, and all end users of the architecture. With every project, the team sets out to understand the cultural setting of the work and then develops an appropriate response. It is a method that celebrates and respects the latent beauty and merit in what is present, what has been, and what could come next. They enjoy the practical and poetic potential in the way buildings are made and engage fully in each step towards the realisation of the designs. The practice looks at architecture as a frame for life at all its levels; they believe it should act wisely and with humour and kindness.

    "description": "We consider ourselves as architectural scientists combining methods of old with technologies of the future to create the exceptional. We view our office as a laboratory where we are continuously experimenting to stay at the forefront of industry evolution. Every project, built or un-built, follows a key-narrative that is identified at an early stage. Once found, it is rolled out over the entire project - no matter what scale. This enables an enforced design statement and ideas start to complement each other. These are the reasons why we prefer to be involved in projects down to the last detail – from the urban context to the architectural space to the finishes and furniture. The key to our successful approach to architecture is our focus on constant evolution and iteration. There is a constant, unconstrained progress whether it is through re-discovering historical techniques or researching, creating and testing new methods and radical ideas. In the search for ever more sustainable solutions research becomes essential.

Our design process encompasses the relationships people have with buildings, spaces and each other. Taking a broader approach not only leads to strong physical connections, through massing and form, it also fosters strong emotional connections with the community. Joining everything up does, however, necessitate a different architectural mindset. Local neighbourhoods, by their very nature, involve many stakeholders, and accommodating every point of view can lead to numerous compromises. The best schemes, we believe, are those that reach consensus by shaping an overarching vision, which the whole community will support. Rather than begin with design concepts, we start with the best overall experience and then work back to the architecture needed to deliver it. For us, design should create an experience that delights and improves the lives of everyone. We believe the only way to do this is with a joined up approach. By walking the streets, by living social value, by serving the greater good our mission is to help create the thriving neighbourhoods of the future. Neighbourhoods that everyone can be proud of.

This leads to collaborative projects that form a harmony with their surroundings through impeccable craftsmanship and sustainable materiality. Working on cultural, commercial and private buildings, as well as interior, landscape and exhibition design, we respect the cultural heritage of each context while introducing a sophisticated language that delights in its unexpected details. This enduring dialogue between the grand and the intimate, the raw and the refined, the ancient and the modern, results in thoughtfully told stories that confirm our belief that how we live – and where we inhabit ­– is nurtured by robust, honest design.

We blend design sensibility and craft with social agency, working closely with ethnic minority groups and organisations. We listen to the often unheard voices of marginalised communities; translating their stories into architectural propositions.

We are an energetic team, based at our studio in Ilford, Redbridge, with buildings in the UK and Latin America. Recently, Studio Gil was selected by the Architects Journal AJ100 (2020) as one of 25 ‘Disruptor’ practices, demonstrating an alternative approach to British practice through our socially engaged work.

We provide a full service from feasibility, planning, architectural design and construction supervision to also include interior and graphic design. We use Building Information Modelling (BIM) for complex projects to provide for iterative early stage designs, developed building components, documentation, schedules and wider design team coordination. Our designs — often bold and contemporary — are underpinned by an interplay of imagination and technical rigour, mostly accompanied with an element of surprise in their concept and delivery. The spaces we create are well-used and loved. We value lateral thinking and non-conformity. We aspire to challenge and exceed the client’s brief and provide innovative and sustainable solutions that are both delightful and spatially inspiring. Each year we pledge 5-10% of our time to good causes through meaningful Pro-Bono work to serve the less fortunate in society.

By adopting this more nuanced approach, we are able to guide our client’s expectations from the outset. Our success in gaining consent, even in sensitive conservation areas and when dealing with heritage assets, is testament to the way in which we work. We adopt a light touch, low energy approach to architecture for both new build and retrofit. Many of our projects employ Passivhaus principles and we aim to make the most of a site’s intrinsic natural resources. We believe that the spaces between buildings should be well designed and integrate our schemes with their wider setting.

The studio has a friendly and relaxed atmosphere and we firmly believe that good design should be a enjoyable process. The result of this is achieved by collaboration, where all members of the studio can openly contribute and ask each other, and our clients, “what if?” Through this approach we aim to identify and achieve the full potential of every project we work on.

This ethos influences every activity of our architectural practice and we seek to embed these values in how we work with our clients, our team, our partnerships and communities. Our award winning architecture practice has an established reputation for being at the forefront of both housing and mixed use design. Our focus is not the size of a project but its potential. Our schemes range from creating individual single family homes to unlocking the potential on small and complex sites to delivering large mixed use & residential developments of 150 units. We work with communities to understand their needs, designing appropriate typologies to accommodate families with integrated landscapes & play, compact units with generous shared amenity, specialist housing for supported living and co & multi-generational living. We work with leading housing providers including Pocket Living, BeFirst and Brick x Brick to design and deliver healthy mixed use developments. Our buildings are healthy on the inside and healthy for the outside world. We work with our clients to target net zero, designing the fabric of our buildings to work hard, minimising waste, re-using or selecting materials which are recycled or with low embodied energy, integrating biodiversity and harnessing technology to reduce carbon footprints and energy use. Everything we make has a positive impact. Address Studio 9, The Dove Centre, 109 Bartholemew Road, London, NW5 2BJ Contact Renée Searle Twitter @threefoldarch Instagram threefold_architects",

We incorporated in 2005 following our participation in the collaborative custom-build housing project ‘In-Between’ in North London. Since then, we have created fine, handcrafted projects, which have been widely published. The stuff of life makes us hum. We embrace that we are all different: We are all bespoke. We come in different sizes. We have different families. We grow and we grow older. We like different things. So each of us has different expectations of what a home can be. Our studio has designed for many diverse individuals and households and have a wealth of experience in delivering homes for real people- beyond the traditional house and beyond standardised mass housing. Our research can be upscaled and incorporated in urban housing, giving clients more options and making richer, more sustainable homes and places. Not only do we engage in domestic architecture and housing but also work in urban and community contexts to make high quality, beautiful projects and environments. We never see spaces in isolation, but as part of a larger collection of rooms and spaces and set within a wider context. As a studio we question and re-invent typologies with enthusiasm and a sense of optimism. Together with our consultants and contractors we work through every step of the process to deliver cost-effective, distinct and elegant designs uniquely around our clients and their extended ‘families’. We are a women-led and British Caribbean practice and equal opportunity employer. We work closely with our consultants and with our contractors through every step of the design and construction process to deliver both cost effective and elegant designs. Our directors develop each project uniquely around our client and their family, they are at the heart of each project at all times.

As we are based in London, many of our projects fuse the old and the new to revitalize older buildings with modern interventions. We bring imaginative design solutions to all our projects, whether individual private homes or larger developments, producing rewarding and inspiring results. Our passion for construction leads to an expressive architecture displaying the elemental character of construction and habitation, whilst questioning and dissolving the differences between the physical elements of enclosure and the spatial aspects of interior and exterior. We enjoy undertaking all phases of a project from concept to completion. We have a reputation for strong delivery as well as design creativity.

This is evident in the material quality of buildings completed by the practice, which combine intellectual rigour with a sensual appreciation of space, light and materiality. Our work is underpinned by a passionate belief in the importance of design excellence and detailed research into appropriate and innovative building materials and technologies. We design bold, contemporary, imaginative buildings that are fit for purpose, accessible and loved by the people who use them. Our approach also involves a lot of collaboration, which we believe is fundamental to successful projects. It means having open, honest and productive dialogue with our clients, design team and others who have a stake in the project. It means guiding people through the design process from the start to the end – even those who thought they had little to contribute – so that they can make informed decisions and we can approach challenges together. We ask the right questions and we listen to the answers, translating them into ideas that can be developed through conversation. We love working with people who share this collaborative ethos: one client said our consultation was conducted ‘to a high level of professionalism, with little fuss, and a sense of humour. An architectural practice with flair and expertise, and without ego.’ Address 2 Wilkin Street, London, NW5 2NL Contact Michal Cohen Instagram waltersandcohen",

We value simplicity and elegance; what is essential to ensure the intelligent use of the world’s resources.

    "description": "what if: projects is an award-winning architecture practice, and we have a track record of providing high-quality architectural services tailored to the requirements of public and third-sector clients. We work collaboratively and flexibly with often complex stakeholder and client groups to accommodate project-specific processes and timelines. Our small team brings creativity and extensive experience to project development. We pay attention to detail and are committed to delivering all our work to a high standard. Our selection to the Mayor of London’s A+U Framework (2023) to support High Street & Town Centre Recovery has recognised the quality of our practice. We seek to work with clients who want to explore creative approaches in response to the biodiversity and climate crisis. Below an overview of our interests and the fields of work we engage with: HOUSING ENVIRONMENTS: We work in the social housing context to adapt existing buildings, transform shared open spaces, and create the social infrastructure that complements housing. Our participatory process is guided by a commitment to sustainability and resilience. BUILDING DESIGN: Embracing a non-fussy, simple, and restrained design language, we have refurbished, reconfigured, and expanded existing structures to accommodate changing needs and designed proposals for zero-carbon public buildings. ACTIVE TRAVEL: We design urban environments around active, human-powered transport to reduce air pollution and enhance living conditions. Collaborating with stakeholders such as local governments, policymakers, campaign groups, highway engineers, schools, and citizens, we develop strategies and deliver projects prioritising cycling and walking. PUBLIC SPACE: Our public realm work focuses on ordinary streets and neglected open spaces. We collaborate with neighbourhoods and borough councils to create urban environments that improve the quality of life for people and nature. Greening is a key objective – from tree planting to sustainable urban drainage solutions. URBAN RESILIENCE: Our projects leverage local knowledge and community participation to create more equitable, climate-resilient urban environments. We support grassroots organisations in their efforts to effect change locally. Small projects can bring powerful, positive outcomes for people and places. ARTISTIC PRACTICE: Our work is grounded in artistic practice and evolved through art commissions and collaborations. These initiatives are calls for action, provocations and critiques of given conditions. They are a testbed for ideas and, at times, the beginning of something new.

    "description": "We work with sustainable architecture, urban design, landscape architecture and interior design for current and future generations. Our mission is to enable sustainable life through the art of architecture. Our vision is that by 2030 all our architecture will be climate neutral, through design excellence. Responsibility, curiosity, involvement and respect are core values that imbue everything we do. Our values remain the constant in a world of change. We work with sustainable architecture, design and urban development in an international context. We need to act responsibly as our work affects the lives of many both present and future generations. We create spaces for people to thrive and grow in harmony with the ecosystem that we inhabit. We act responsibly by operating within the sustainable limits of our planet when we design healthy living environments that inspire and engage. Our curiosity is reflected in the way we work. We believe that search for new knowledge will strengthen our offer for the future. Therefore, we continuously invest in research and development. Through design, creativity and a humanistic approach, we look to solve great challenges. We believe that architecture is shaped by the unique qualities of its context. This makes us radical contextualists. Our 700+ employees are continually developing their knowledge base and generating innovative typologies and tools, and White Research Lab and our R&D foundation both support research projects geared towards creating maximum value in projects. We have design skills to tackle major regeneration schemes in the rapid transition from an industrial to a technological age. Key projects reflecting the scale of that transition and our experience include the making of Hammarby Sjöstad in central Stockholm – the city’s first ‘environmentally profiled’ regeneration projects. Hammarby, in which White played a prominent role, is one of Europe’s most highly regarded urban regeneration projects. Our recent Completion of 1200 homes on the Gascoigne Estate in Barking, is an example of delivering a high density landscape led masterplan. Our masterplans for Charlton Riverside, Barking Riverside and more recently Malmo Quays on the River Tyne in Newcastle shows how we work with the Scandinavian background and experience, translating this into the context in the UK and abroad.

Our work ranges from pavilions to private homes, community centres to concept stores, all of them the product of a principled, resourceful approach. We make well. We find healthy and progressive materials, optimise the way they are put together and build with great technique to make buildings loved by their users and communities. We find worth. Our experience shows us that the best buildings unfold from a bespoke and enjoyably energetic design process where every person’s views are valued, all opportunities are uncovered, and we get the very best out of the resources we use. We see further. We build the kind of architecture we’d like others to build too: future-facing projects where the architects are more broadly accountable for their actions, and lean, pragmatic, beautiful buildings that last longer, use less – and feel just right.

We work with the various inputs, histories, technologies and constraints with which we are presented to formulate a response rather than imposing an abstract theology, manifesto or style. We, as architects, are editors of the process. The questions, and the problems, can be incredibly complex, but a successful answer should be as simple as Yes or No. While disparate in nature, scale, form and material, our projects are all characterised by a combination of pragmatic problem solving and idealistic ingenuity.

The Human. We are interested in the everyday lived experience of landscapes. We work collaboratively with communities to understand the life that underpins a place, exploring the connections and barriers to engaging with space, and finding ways to reconnect people who feel disconnected from – or alienated by – their contexts. The Natural. We are interested in nature in all its venerated and unruly forms, embracing its existence and persistence within the structure of the city. Through our work, we explore the power of natural landscapes on the human psyche, their dialogue with the built environment, and the potential of urban ecologies to support both nature and daily wellbeing.
